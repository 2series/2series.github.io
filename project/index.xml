      <description> Intro &amp;amp; Background Linear regression being one of the most basic and popular algorithms in machine learning, so when aspiring data scientist starts off in this field, linear regression is inevitably the first algorithm they come across.

      <title>Build A Simple Blockchain</title>

      <description>Intro &amp;amp; Background Blockchain is a data structure that was first introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin protocol white paper a decade ago. Bitcoin’s blockchain stores transaction data, but we can store any type of data in a blockchain.
Ethereum, for example, enables users to store code snippets called ‘smart contracts’ in their blockchain. In this project, I build a simple blockchain in Python that uses proof-of-work consensus, just like the Bitcoin protocol does.</description>

      <guid>/project/password_detection_strength/password-detection-strength/</guid>
      <description>Intro &amp;amp; Background A function written that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at least one digit. You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.
