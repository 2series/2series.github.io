      <description>Sample Sales Data, Order Info, Sales, Customer, Shipping, etc., Used for Segmentation, Customer Analytics, Clustering and More. Inspired for retail analytics. This was originally used for Pentaho DI Kettle, But I found the set could be useful for Sales Simulation training.

      <description>About the dataset In this analysis, we explore the dplyr functions used to ask interesting questions of a more complex dataset We’ll use a dataset of flights that departed from New York city airports (including Newark, John F. Kennedy, and Laguardia airports) in 2013. This dataset is also featured online in the Introduction to dplyr vignette, and is drawn from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics database.
This dataset will use over 300,000 observations to ask the following questions:</description>

      <description>Preamble: The dataset is available at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency].
 Reseach questions: to explore three data points, and visualize how they influence the energy load.  The following variables Wall.Area, Roof.Area, Glazing.Area are identified as key indicators that can influence the energy load efficiency for both (Heating and Cooling spaces).
 Structure of analysis: A time series forecast using the arima model as follows:

      <description>Preamble: This document focuses on the analysis of the airpassengers dataframe.
The AirPassenger dataset in R provides monthly totals of US airline passengers, from 1949 to 1960.
Description of dataframe airpassengers can be found at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/airpassengers.html
 Research question: through analysis and modelling, preview a time series forecast   Structure of analysis: I will asssess whether a linear regression or arima model is a best fit for the time series forecast as follows:</description>

      <description>Preamble: This document focuses on the analysis of the diamonds data frame.
Descriotion of data frame diamonds can be found at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/diamonds.html
 Research questions: am i getting a fair deal when I purchase a diamond?
 The goal is to build a predictive model for diamonds, that is going to help figure out whether a given diamond is a good deal or a rip-off!
   Structure of analysis: I will use Linear Regression to predict the diamond price using other varaibles in the diamonds dataframe.</description>

 Research questions: is a vehicle with auto or manual transmission better in terms of miles p/gallons(mpg)?
 quantify the (mpg) difference between auto &amp;amp; manual transmission.
