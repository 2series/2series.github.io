Basic inferential data analysis.  Analysis 1. A simulation exercise. In this analysis I’ll investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. I’ll investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.\nIllustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.

As the US pursues a portfolio of more diverse, sustainable and secure energy sources, there are many questions to consider.\nWhat are effective factors in incentivizing states to adopt more environmentally friendly energy generation methods? How do these factors vary by state? How can we direct resources to different places in the country and ensure that they effectively drive renewable energy sources adoption?  To derive insights and explore these questions, I’ll take a combination of generation, usage, and greenhouse emission data by state and combine it with macro-economic and political information.\nFor this analysis, I’ve gathered data from various sources to include the following information for each state within the U.S. for the years spanning year 2000 to year 2013. The aggregated dataset energy.csv.xz results in a total of 27 variables and 699 observations. Each observation contains one record per state per year. Here’s a detailed description of the variables:\n GenTotal: Annual generation of energy using all types of energy sources (coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, etc.) normalized by the state population at a given year. GenTotalRenewable: Annual generation of energy using all renewable energy sources normalized by the state population at a given year. GenHydro, GenSolar: Annual generation of energy using each type of energy source as a percent of the total energy generation. GenTotalRenewableBinary, GenSolarBinary: 1 if generation from solar or other renewable energy sources increased between a year n and a year n+1. 0 if it did not increase. AllSourcesCO2, AllSourcesSO2 and AllSourcesNOx: Annual emissions per state in metric tons, normalized by the respective state population at a given year and caused by all energy generation sources. EPriceResidential, EPriceCommercial, EPriceIndustrial, EPriceTransportation, EPriceTotal: Average electricity price per state, per sector (residential, industrial, commercial, etc.) ESalesResidential, ESalesCommercial, ESalesIndustrial, ESalesTransportation, ESalesTotal: Annual normalized sales of electricity per state, per sector. CumlRegulatory, CumlFinancial: Number of energy-related financial incentives and regulations created by a state per year. Demographic data such as annual wages per capita and presidential results (0 if a state voted republican, 1 is democrat).

Graphs are comprised of vertices (also often called “nodes”) and edges connecting those nodes. In this analysis, I’ll explore how to visualize networks using the igraph package in R.\nI’ll visualize social networking data using anonymized data from Facebook; this data was originally curated in a recent paper about computing social circles in social networks. In our visualizations, the vertices in our network will represent Facebook users and the edges will represent these users being Facebook friends with each other.\nThe first file I’ll use, edges.csv, contains variables V1 and V2, which label the endpoints of edges in our network. Each row represents a pair of users in our graph who are Facebook friends. For a pair of friends A and B, edges.csv will only contain a single row – the smaller identifier will be listed first in this row. From this row, I’ll know that A is friends with B and B is friends with A.\nThe second file, users.csv, contains information about the Facebook users, who are the vertices in our network. This file contains the following variables:\n id: A unique identifier for this user; this is the value that appears in the rows of edges.csv gender: An identifier for the gender of a user taking the values A and B. Because the data is anonymized, we don’t know which value refers to males and which value refers to females. school: An identifier for the school the user attended taking the values A and AB (users with AB attended school A as well as another school B). Because the data is anonymized, we don’t know the schools represented by A and B. locale: An identifier for the locale of the user taking the values A and B. Because the data is anonymized, we don’t know which value refers to what locale.

The other option is an undirected graph, which means that the relations between the vertices are symmetric.\nNow, we want to plot our graph. By default, the vertices are large and have text labels of a user’s identifier, this would clutter the output.\nWe will plot with no text labels and smaller vertices:\nplot(g, vertex.size=5, vertex.label=NA) In this graph, there are a number of groups of nodes where all the nodes in each group are connected but, the groups are disjoint from one another, forming “islands” in the graph. Such groups are called “connected components,” or “components” for short.\nHow many connected components with at least 2 nodes are there in the graph? #### 4\nHow many users are there with no friends in the network? #### 7\n Problem 2.3 - Creating a Network In our graph, the “degree” of a node is its number of friends. We have already seen that some nodes in our graph have degree 0 (these are the nodes with no friends), while others have much higher degree. We can use degree(g) to compute the degree of all the nodes in our graph g.\ndegree(g) 3981 3982 3983 3984 3985 3986 3987 3988 3989 3990 3991 3992 3993 3994 3995 7 13 1 0 5 8 1 6 5 3 2 2 5 10 8 594 3996 3997 3998 3999 4000 4001 4002 4003 4004 4005 4006 4007 4008 4009 3 3 10 13 3 8 1 6 4 9 2 1 3 0 9 4010 4011 4012 4013 4014 4015 4016 4017 4018 4019 4020 4021 4022 4023 4024 0 3 1 5 11 0 3 8 6 7 7 10 0 17 0 4025 4026 4027 4028 4029 4030 4031 4032 4033 4034 4035 4036 4037 4038 3 8 6 1 1 18 10 1 2 1 0 1 3 8  How many users are friends with 10 or more other Facebook users in this network?\nsum(degree(g) \u0026gt;= 10) [1] 9  Problem 2.4 - Creating a Network In a network, it’s often visually useful to draw attention to “important” nodes in the network. While this might mean different things in different contexts, in a social network we might consider a user with a large number of friends to be an important user. From the previous problem, we know this is the same as saying that nodes with a high degree are important users.\nTo visually draw attention to these nodes, we will change the size of the vertices so the vertices with high degrees are larger. To do this, we will change the “size” attribute of the vertices of our graph to be an increasing function of their degrees:\nV(g)$size \u0026lt;- degree(g)/2+2 Now, that we have specified the vertex size of each vertex, we will no longer use the vertex.size parameter when we plot our graph:\nplot(g, vertex.label=NA) What is the largest size we assigned to any node in our graph?\nmax(V(g)$size) [1] 11 What is the smallest size we assigned to any node in our graph?\nmin(V(g)$size) [1] 2  Problem 3.1 - Coloring Vertices Thus far, we have changed the “size” attributes of our vertices. However, we can also change the colors of vertices to capture additional information about the Facebook users we are depicting.\nWhen changing the size of nodes, we first obtained the vertices of our graph with V(g) and then accessed the the size attribute with V(g)\\(size. To change the color, we will update the attribute V(g)\\)color.\nTo color the vertices based on the gender of the user, we will need access to that variable. When we created our graph g, we provided it with the dataframe users, which had variables gender, school, and locale. These are now stored as attributes V(g)\\(gender, V(g)\\)school, and V(g)$locale.\nWe can update the colors by setting the color to black for all vertices, than setting it to red for the vertices with gender A and setting it to gray for the vertices with gender B:\nV(g)$color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot; V(g)$color[V(g)$gender == \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;] = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot; V(g)$color[V(g)$gender == \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;] = \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot; Ploting the resulting graph.\nWhat is the gender of the users with the highest degree in the graph?\nplot(g, vertex.label=NA) Gender B\n Problem 3.2 - Coloring Vertices Now, color the vertices based on the school that each user in our network attended.\ntable(V(g)$school)  A AB 40 17 2  V(g)$color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot; V(g)$color[V(g)$school == \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;] = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot; V(g)$color[V(g)$school == \u0026quot;AB\u0026quot;] = \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot; plot(g, vertex.label=NA) Are the two users who attended both schools A and B Facebook friends with each other? #### Yes\nWhat best describes the users with highest degree? #### Some, but not all, of the high-degree users attended school A\n Problem 3.3 - Coloring Vertices Now, color the vertices based on the locale of the user.\ntable(V(g)$locale)  A B 3 6 50  V(g)$color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot; V(g)$color[V(g)$locale == \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;] = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot; V(g)$color[V(g)$locale == \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;] = \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot; plot(g, vertex.label=NA) The large connected component is most associated with which locale? #### Locale B\nThe 4-user connected component is most associated with which locale? #### Locale A\n Problem 4 - Other Plotting Options The help page is a helpful tool when making visualizations.

We separated our data into a training set, containing data from 2004 and 2008 polls, and a test-set, containing the data from 2012 polls. We then proceeded to develop a logistic regression model to forecast the 2012 US presidential election.\nIn this problem, we’ll revisit our logistic regression model, and learn how to plot the output on a map of the United States. Unlike what we did prevously, this time we’ll be plotting predictions rather than data!\nFirst, load the ggplot2, maps, and ggmap packages using the library function. All three packages should be installed on your computer from lecture, but if not, you may need to install them too using the install.packages function.\nThen, load the US map and save it to the variable statesMap:\nstatesMap = map_data(“state”)\nThe maps package contains other built-in maps, including a US county map, a world map, and maps for France and Italy.\n# Load states map statesMap = map_data(\u0026quot;state\u0026quot;) Problem 1.1 - Drawing a Map of the US If you look at the structure of the statesMap dataframe using the str function, you should see that there are 6 variables.

We’ll rebuild the model here, using the dataset PollingImputed.csv. Be sure to use this file so that you don’t have to redo the imputation to fill in the missing values, like we did in the Unit 3 Recitation.\nLoad the data using the read.csv function, and call it “polling”.

Note that we only have 45 states in our testing set, since we are missing observations for Alaska, Delaware, Alabama, Wyoming, and Vermont, so these states will not appear colored in our map.\nThen, create a logistic regression model and make predictions on the test-set using the following code:\nmod2 \u0026lt;- glm(Republican ~ SurveyUSA + DiffCount, data = Train, family = \u0026quot;binomial\u0026quot;) TestPrediction \u0026lt;- predict(mod2, newdata = Test, type = \u0026quot;response\u0026quot;) TestPrediction gives the predicted probabilities for each state, but let’s also create a vector of Republican/Democrat predictions by using the following code:\nTestPredictionBinary \u0026lt;- as.numeric(TestPrediction \u0026gt; 0.5) Now, put the predictions and state labels in a data.frame so that we can use ggplot:\npredictionDataFrame \u0026lt;- data.frame(TestPrediction, TestPredictionBinary, Test$State) To make sure everything went smoothly, answer the following.\nFor how many states is our binary prediction 1 (for 2012), corresponding to Republican?\nstr(TestPredictionBinary)  num [1:45] 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 ... table(TestPredictionBinary) TestPredictionBinary 0 1 23 22  22\nWhat is the average predicted probability of our model (on the Test set, for 2012)?\nmean(TestPrediction) [1] 0.4852626  Problem 2.2 - Coloring the States by Predictions Now, we need to merge “predictionDataFrame” with the map data “statesMap”. Before doing so, we need to convert the Test.State variable to lowercase, so that it matches the region variable in statesMap.\npredictionDataFrame$region \u0026lt;- tolower(predictionDataFrame$Test.State) # Now, merge the two data frames using the following command: predictionMap \u0026lt;- merge(statesMap, predictionDataFrame, by = \u0026quot;region\u0026quot;) # Lastly, we need to make sure the observations are in order so that the map is # drawn properly, by typing the following: predictionMap \u0026lt;- predictionMap[order(predictionMap$order),] How many observations are there in predictionMap?\nstr(predictionMap) \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 15034 obs. of 9 variables: $ region : chr \u0026quot;arizona\u0026quot; \u0026quot;arizona\u0026quot; \u0026quot;arizona\u0026quot; \u0026quot;arizona\u0026quot; ... $ long : num -115 -115 -115 -115 -115 ... $ lat : num 35 35.1 35.1 35.2 35.2 ... $ group : num 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ order : int 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 ... $ subregion : chr NA NA NA NA ... $ TestPrediction : num 0.974 0.974 0.974 0.974 0.974 ... $ TestPredictionBinary: num 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ Test.State : Factor w/ 50 levels \u0026quot;Alabama\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Alaska\u0026quot;,..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...

Problem 2.3 - Coloring the States by Predictions When we merged the data in the previous problem, it caused the number of observations to change. Why? Check out the help page for merge by typing ?merge to help us answer this question. #### Because we only make predictions for 45 states, we no longer have observations for some of the states. These observations were removed in the merging process.\n Problem 2.4 - Coloring the States by Predictions Now we are ready to color the US map with our predictions! You can color the states according to our binary predictions by typing the following code:\nggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPredictionBinary)) + geom_polygon(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) The states appear light blue and dark blue in this map. Which color represents a Republican prediction? #### Light blue\n Problem 2.5 - Coloring the States by Predictions We see that the legend displays a blue gradient for outcomes between 0 and 1. However, when plotting the binary predictions there are only two possible outcomes: 0 or 1.\nLet’s replot the map with discrete outcomes. We can also change the color scheme to blue and red, to match the blue color associated with the Democratic Party in the US and the red color associated with the Republican Party in the US.\nggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPredictionBinary)) + geom_polygon(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, guide = \u0026quot;legend\u0026quot;, breaks= c(0,1), labels = c(\u0026quot;Democrat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Republican\u0026quot;), name = \u0026quot;Prediction 2012\u0026quot;) Alternatively, we could plot the probabilities instead of the binary predictions. Change the plot code above to instead color the states by the variable TestPrediction. You should see a gradient of colors ranging from red to blue.\nDo the colors of the states in the map for TestPrediction look different from the colors of the states in the map with TestPredictionBinary? Why or why not?\nggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPrediction)) + geom_polygon(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, guide = \u0026quot;legend\u0026quot;, breaks= c(0,1), labels = c(\u0026quot;Democrat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Republican\u0026quot;), name = \u0026quot;Prediction 2012\u0026quot;) round(TestPrediction, 2)  7 10 13 16 19 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 51 0.97 1.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.96 0.99 0.00 1.00 0.00 1.00 0.06 0.95 0.99 1.00 54 57 60 63 66 69 72 75 78 81 84 87 90 93 96 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.93 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.95 99 102 105 108 111 114 117 120 123 126 129 134 137 140 143 1.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.99 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.02 0.00 1.00 0.00  The two maps look very similar. This is because most of our predicted probabilities are close to 0 or close to 1. NOTE: If you have a hard time seeing the red/blue gradient, feel free to change the color scheme, by changing the arguments low = “blue” and high = “red” to colors of your choice (to see all of the color options in R, type colors() in your R console). You can even change it to a gray scale, by changing the low and high colors to “gray” and “black”.\n  Problem 3.1 - Understanding the Predictions In the 2012 election, the state of Florida ended up being a very close race. It was ultimately won by the Democratic party. Did we predict this state correctly or incorrectly? To see the names and locations of the different states, take a look at the World Atlas map here. #### We incorrectly predicted this state by predicting that it would be won by the Republican party.\n Problem 3.2 - Understanding the Predictions What was our predicted probability for the state of Florida?\npredictionDataFrame[predictionDataFrame$region == \u0026quot;florida\u0026quot;, ]  TestPrediction TestPredictionBinary Test.State region 24 0.9640395 1 Florida florida What does this imply? #### Our prediction model did not do a very good job of correctly predicting the state of Florida, and we were very confident in our incorrect prediction.\n PROBLEM 4 - PARAMETER SETTINGS In this part, we’ll explore what the different parameter settings of geom_polygon do. Throughout the problem, use the help page for geom_polygon, which can be accessed by ?geom_polygon. To see more information about a certain parameter, just type a question mark and then the parameter name to get the help page for that parameter. Experiment with different parameter settings to try and replicate the plots!\nWe’ll be asking questions about the following three plots:\n Problem 4.1 - Parameter Settings Plots (1) and (2) were created by setting different parameters of geom_polygon to the value 3.\nggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPrediction)) + geom_polygon(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, guide = \u0026quot;legend\u0026quot;, breaks= c(0,1), labels = c(\u0026quot;Democrat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Republican\u0026quot;), name = \u0026quot;Prediction 2012\u0026quot;) ?geom_polygon What is the name of the parameter we set to have value 3 to create plot (1)?\nggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPrediction)) + geom_polygon(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, linetype = 3) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, guide = \u0026quot;legend\u0026quot;, breaks= c(0,1), labels = c(\u0026quot;Democrat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Republican\u0026quot;), name = \u0026quot;Prediction 2012\u0026quot;) linetype\nWhat is the name of the parameter we set to have value 3 to create plot (2)?\nggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPrediction)) + geom_polygon(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, size = 3) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, guide = \u0026quot;legend\u0026quot;, breaks= c(0,1), labels = c(\u0026quot;Democrat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Republican\u0026quot;), name = \u0026quot;Prediction 2012\u0026quot;) size\n Problem 4.2 - Parameter Settings Plot (3) was created by changing the value of a different geom_polygon parameter to have value 0.3.

Clustering is a common technique for market segmentation since it automatically finds similar groups given a dataset.\nIn this analysis, I’ll see how clustering can be used to find similar groups of customers who belong to an airline’s frequent flyer program. The airline is trying to learn more about its customers so that it can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers.\nThe file AirlinesCluster.csv contains information on 3,999 members of the frequent flyer program. This data comes from the textbook Data Mining for Business Intelligence, by Galit Shmueli, Nitin R. Patel, and Peter C. Bruce. For more information, see the website for the book.\nThere are seven different variables in the dataset, described below:\n Balance = number of miles eligible for award travel QualMiles = number of miles qualifying for TopFlight status BonusMiles = number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months BonusTrans = number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months FlightMiles = number of flight miles in the past 12 months FlightTrans = number of flight transactions in the past 12 months DaysSinceEnroll = number of days since enrolled in the frequent flyer program  Problem 1.1 - Normalizing the Data Read the dataset AirlinesCluster.csv into R and call it “airlines”.\nairlines \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;AirlinesCluster.csv\u0026quot;) Looking at the summary of airlines, which TWO variables have (on average) the smallest values?\nsummary(airlines)  Balance QualMiles BonusMiles BonusTrans Min. : 0 Min. : 0.0 Min. : 0 Min. : 0.0 1st Qu.: 18528 1st Qu.: 0.0 1st Qu.: 1250 1st Qu.: 3.0 Median : 43097 Median : 0.0 Median : 7171 Median :12.0 Mean : 73601 Mean : 144.1 Mean : 17145 Mean :11.6 3rd Qu.: 92404 3rd Qu.: 0.0 3rd Qu.: 23800 3rd Qu.:17.0 Max. :1704838 Max. :11148.0 Max. :263685 Max. :86.0 FlightMiles FlightTrans DaysSinceEnroll Min. : 0.0 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 2 1st Qu.: 0.0 1st Qu.: 0.000 1st Qu.:2330 Median : 0.0 Median : 0.000 Median :4096 Mean : 460.1 Mean : 1.374 Mean :4119 3rd Qu.: 311.0 3rd Qu.: 1.000 3rd Qu.:5790 Max. :30817.0 Max. :53.000 Max. :8296  BonusTrans and FlightTrans\n Problem 1.2 - Normalizing the Data In this problem, we will normalize our data before we run the clustering algorithms.\nWhy is it important to normalize the data before clustering? #### If we don’t normalize the data, the clustering will be dominated by the variables that are on a larger scale.\n Problem 1.3 - Normalizing the Data Let’s go ahead and normalize our data. You can normalize the variables in a dataframe by using the preProcess function in the “caret” package.\nNow, create a normalized dataframe called “airlinesNorm” by running the following code:\npreproc \u0026lt;- preProcess(airlines) airlinesNorm \u0026lt;- predict(preproc, airlines) The first code pre-processes the data, and the second code performs the normalization. If you look at the summary of airlinesNorm, you should see that all of the variables now have mean zero. You can also see that each of the variables has standard deviation 1 by using the sd() function.\nsummary(airlinesNorm)  Balance QualMiles BonusMiles BonusTrans Min. :-0.7303 Min. :-0.1863 Min. :-0.7099 Min. :-1.20805 1st Qu.:-0.5465 1st Qu.:-0.1863 1st Qu.:-0.6581 1st Qu.:-0.89568 Median :-0.3027 Median :-0.1863 Median :-0.4130 Median : 0.04145 Mean : 0.0000 Mean : 0.0000 Mean : 0.0000 Mean : 0.00000 3rd Qu.: 0.1866 3rd Qu.:-0.1863 3rd Qu.: 0.2756 3rd Qu.: 0.56208 Max. :16.1868 Max. :14.2231 Max. :10.2083 Max. : 7.74673 FlightMiles FlightTrans DaysSinceEnroll Min. :-0.3286 Min. :-0.36212 Min. :-1.99336 1st Qu.:-0.3286 1st Qu.:-0.36212 1st Qu.:-0.86607 Median :-0.3286 Median :-0.36212 Median :-0.01092 Mean : 0.0000 Mean : 0.00000 Mean : 0.00000 3rd Qu.:-0.1065 3rd Qu.:-0.09849 3rd Qu.: 0.80960 Max. :21.6803 Max. :13.61035 Max. : 2.02284  sd(airlinesNorm$Balance) [1] 1 sd(airlinesNorm$FlightTrans) [1] 1 In the normalized data, which variable has the largest maximum value? #### FlightMiles\nIn the normalized data, which variable has the smallest minimum value? #### DaysSinceEnroll\n Problem 2.1 - Hierarchical Clustering Compute the distances between data points (using euclidean distance) and then run the Hierarchical clustering algorithm (using method=“ward.D”) on the normalized data. It may take a few minutes for the code to finish since the dataset has a large number of observations for hierarchical clustering.\ndistAirlines \u0026lt;- dist(airlinesNorm, method = \u0026quot;euclidean\u0026quot;) hclustAirlines \u0026lt;- hclust(distAirlines, method = \u0026quot;ward.D\u0026quot;) Then, plot the dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering process. Suppose the airline is looking for somewhere between 2 and 10 clusters. According to the dendrogram, which of the following is NOT a good choice for the number of clusters?\nplot(hclustAirlines) 6\n Problem 2.2 - Hierarchical Clustering Suppose that after looking at the dendrogram and discussing with the marketing department, the airline decides to proceed with 5 clusters. Divide the data points into 5 clusters by using the cutree function.\nHow many data points are in Cluster 1?\nhclustGroups \u0026lt;- cutree(hclustAirlines, k = 5) table(hclustGroups) hclustGroups 1 2 3 4 5 776 519 494 868 1342  776\n Problem 2.3 - Hierarchical Clustering Now, use tapply to compare the average values in each of the variables for the 5 clusters (the centroids of the clusters). You may want to compute the average values of the unnormalized data so that it is easier to interpret. You can do this for the variable “Balance”.\nstr(airlines) \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 3999 obs. of 7 variables: $ Balance : int 28143 19244 41354 14776 97752 16420 84914 20856 443003 104860 ... $ QualMiles : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ BonusMiles : int 174 215 4123 500 43300 0 27482 5250 1753 28426 ... $ BonusTrans : int 1 2 4 1 26 0 25 4 43 28 ... $ FlightMiles : int 0 0 0 0 2077 0 0 250 3850 1150 ... $ FlightTrans : int 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 12 3 ... $ DaysSinceEnroll: int 7000 6968 7034 6952 6935 6942 6994 6938 6948 6931 ... tapply(airlines$Balance, hclustGroups, mean)  1 2 3 4 5 57866.90 110669.27 198191.57 52335.91 36255.91  tapply(airlines$QualMiles, hclustGroups, mean)  1 2 3 4 5 0.6443299 1065.9826590 30.3461538 4.8479263 2.5111773  tapply(airlines$BonusMiles, hclustGroups, mean)  1 2 3 4 5 10360.124 22881.763 55795.860 20788.766 2264.788  tapply(airlines$BonusTrans, hclustGroups, mean)  1 2 3 4 5 10.823454 18.229287 19.663968 17.087558 2.973174  tapply(airlines$FlightMiles, hclustGroups, mean)  1 2 3 4 5 83.18428 2613.41811 327.67611 111.57373 119.32191  tapply(airlines$FlightTrans, hclustGroups, mean)  1 2 3 4 5 0.3028351 7.4026975 1.0688259 0.3444700 0.4388972  tapply(airlines$DaysSinceEnroll, hclustGroups, mean)  1 2 3 4 5 6235.365 4402.414 5615.709 2840.823 3060.081  Compared to the other clusters, Cluster 1 has the largest average values in which variables (if any)? #### DaysSinceEnroll\nHow would you describe the customers in Cluster 1? #### Infrequent but loyal customers.\n Problem 2.4 - Hierarchical Clustering Compared to the other clusters, Cluster 2 has the largest average values in which variables? #### QualMiles, FlightMiles, FlightTrans\nHow would you describe the customers in Cluster 2? #### Customers who have accumulated a large amount of miles, and the ones with the largest number of flight transactions.\n Problem 2.5 - Hierarchical Clustering Compared to the other clusters, Cluster 3 has the largest average values in which variables? #### Balance, BonusMiles, BonusTrans\nHow would you describe the customers in Cluster 3? #### Customers who have accumulated a large amount of miles, mostly through non-flight transactions.\n Problem 2.6 - Hierarchical Clustering Compared to the other clusters, Cluster 4 has the largest average values in which variables? #### None\nHow would you describe the customers in Cluster 4? #### Relatively new customers who seem to be accumulating miles, mostly through non-flight transactions.\n Problem 2.7 - Hierarchical Clustering Compared to the other clusters, Cluster 5 has the largest average values in which variables? #### None\nHow would you describe the customers in Cluster 5? #### Relatively new customers who don’t use the airline very often.\n Problem 3.1 - K-Means Clustering Now run the k-means clustering algorithm on the normalized data, again creating 5 clusters.

In this problem, I’ll use cluster-then-predict to predict future stock prices using historical stock data.\nWhen selecting which stocks to invest in, investors seek to obtain good future returns. In this analysis, I’ll first use clustering to identify clusters of stocks that have similar returns over time. Then, use logistic regression to predict whether or not the stocks will have positive future returns.\nFor this problem, I’ll use StocksCluster.csv, which contains monthly stock returns from the NASDAQ stock exchange. The NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange in the world, and it lists many tech companies. The stock price data used in this analysis was obtained from infochimps, a website providing access to many datasets.\nEach observation in the dataset is the monthly returns of a particular company in a particular year. The years included are 2000-2009. The companies are limited to tickers that were listed on the exchange for the entire period 2000-2009, and whose stock price never fell below $1. So, for example, one observation is for Yahoo in 2000, and another observation is for Yahoo in 2001. Our goal will be to predict whether or not the stock return in December will be positive, using the stock returns for the first 11 months of the year.\nThis dataset contains the following variables:\n ReturnJan = the return for the company’s stock during January (in the year of the observation). ReturnFeb = the return for the company’s stock during February (in the year of the observation). ReturnMar = the return for the company’s stock during March (in the year of the observation). ReturnApr = the return for the company’s stock during April (in the year of the observation). ReturnMay = the return for the company’s stock during May (in the year of the observation). ReturnJune = the return for the company’s stock during June (in the year of the observation). ReturnJuly = the return for the company’s stock during July (in the year of the observation). ReturnAug = the return for the company’s stock during August (in the year of the observation). ReturnSep = the return for the company’s stock during September (in the year of the observation). ReturnOct = the return for the company’s stock during October (in the year of the observation). ReturnNov = the return for the company’s stock during November (in the year of the observation). PositiveDec = whether or not the company’s stock had a positive return in December (in the year of the observation). This variable takes value 1 if the return was positive, and value 0 if the return was not positive.  For the first 11 variables, the value stored is a proportional change in stock value during that month.

By investing in stocks for which we are more confident that they will have positive returns (by selecting the ones with higher predicted probabilities), this cluster-then-predict model can give us an edge over the original logistic regression model.\n ","date":1554768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554768000,"objectID":"5a590c082ca3588c01aea5bfd1ad85e0","permalink":"/project/stock_returns/stock/","publishdate":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stock_returns/stock/","section":"project","summary":"Selecting which stocks to invest-in?","tags":["R","Data Analytics","Machine Learning"],"title":"Stock Returns Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The medical literature is enormous! Pubmed, a database of medical publications maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, has indexed over 23 million medical publications. Further, the rate of medical publication has increased over time, and now there are nearly 1 million new publications in the field each year, or more than one per minute.\nThe large size and fast-changing nature of the medical literature has increased the need for reviews, which search databases like Pubmed for papers on a particular topic and then report results from the papers found. While such reviews are often performed manually, with multiple people reviewing each search result, this is tedious and time consuming. In this analysis, I’ll see how text analytics can be used to automate the process of information retrieval.\nThe dataset consists of the titles (variable title) and abstracts (variable abstract) of papers retrieved in a Pubmed search. Each search result is labeled with whether the paper is a clinical trial testing a drug therapy for cancer (variable trial). These labels were obtained by two people reviewing each search result and accessing the actual paper if necessary, as part of a literature review of clinical trials testing drug therapies for advanced and metastatic breast cancer.\nLoading the packages  Problem 1.1 - Loading the Data Load clinical_trial.csv into a dataframe called trials (remembering to add the argument stringsAsFactors=FALSE when working with text analytics, so that the text is read in properply), and investigate the dataframe.\ntrials \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;clinical_trial.csv\u0026quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) str(trials) \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 1860 obs. of 3 variables: $ title : chr \u0026quot;Treatment of Hodgkin\u0026#39;s disease and other cancers with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU; NSC-409962).\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Cell mediated immune status in malignancy--pretherapy and post-therapy assessment.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Neoadjuvant vinorelbine-capecitabine versus docetaxel-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide in early nonresponsive breas\u0026quot;| __truncated__ \u0026quot;Randomized phase 3 trial of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide alone or followed by Paclitaxel for \u0026quot;| __truncated__ ... $ abstract: chr \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Twenty-eight cases of malignancies of different kinds were studied to assess T-cell activity and population bef\u0026quot;| __truncated__ \u0026quot;BACKGROUND: Among breast cancer patients, nonresponse to initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with un\u0026quot;| __truncated__ \u0026quot;BACKGROUND: Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and, as a co\u0026quot;| __truncated__ ... $ trial : int 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 ... summary(trials)  title abstract trial Length:1860 Length:1860 Min. :0.0000 Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.:0.0000 Mode :character Mode :character Median :0.0000 Mean :0.4392 3rd Qu.:1.0000 Max. :1.0000  IMPORTANT NOTE: Should you get an error like “invalid multibyte string” when performing certain parts of this analysis, use the argument fileEncoding=“latin1” when reading in the file with read.csv.

The findings indicated that tamoxifen therapy provided substantial benefit to patients with early stage disease. However, questions arose about how long the observed benefit would persist, about the duration of therapy necessary to maintain maximum benefit, and about the nature and severity of adverse effects from prolonged treatment.PURPOSE: We evaluated the outcome of patients in the B-14 trial through 10 years of follow-up. In addition, the effects of 5 years versus more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared.METHODS: In the trial, patients were initially assigned to receive either tamoxifen at 20 mg/day (n = 1404) or placebo (n = 1414). Tamoxifen-treated patients who remained disease free after 5 years of therapy were then reassigned to receive either another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 322) or 5 years of placebo (n = 321). After the study began, another group of patients who met the same protocol eligibility requirements as the randomly assigned patients were registered to receive tamoxifen (n = 1211). Registered patients who were disease free after 5 years of treatment were also randomly assigned to another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 261) or to 5 years of placebo (n = 249). To compare 5 years with more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, data relating to all patients reassigned to an additional 5 years of the drug were combined. Patients who were not reassigned to either tamoxifen or placebo continued to be followed in the study. Survival, disease-free survival, and distant disease-free survival (relating to failure at distant sites) were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method; differences between the treatment groups were assessed by use of the logrank test. The relative risks of failure (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were determined by use of the Cox proportional hazards model. Reported P values are two-sided.RESULTS: Through 10 years of follow-up, a significant advantage in disease-free survival (69% versus 57%, P \u0026lt; .0001; relative risk = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.58-0.74), distant disease-free survival (76% versus 67%, P \u0026lt; .0001; relative risk = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.61-0.81), and survival (80% versus 76%, P = .02; relative risk = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.71-0.99) was found for patients in the group first assigned to receive tamoxifen. The survival benefit extended to those 49 years of age or younger and to those 50 years of age or older. Tamoxifen therapy was associated with a 37% reduction in the incidence of contralateral (opposite) breast cancer (P = .007). Through 4 years after the reassignment of tamoxifen-treated patients to either continued-therapy or placebo groups, advantages in disease-free survival (92% versus 86%, P = .003) and distant disease-free survival (96% versus 90%, P = .01) were found for those who discontinued tamoxifen treatment. Survival was 96% for those who discontinued tamoxifen compared with 94% for those who continued tamoxifen treatment (P = .08). A higher incidence of thromboembolic events was seen in tamoxifen-treated patients (through 5 years, 1.7% versus 0.4%). Except for endometrial cancer, the incidence of second cancers was not increased with tamoxifen therapy.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy persists through 10 years of follow-up. No additional advantage is obtained from continuing tamoxifen therapy for more than 5 years. trial 664 1 nchar(trials[664, ]$abstract) [1] 3708 3708\n Problem 1.2 - Loading the Data How many search results provided no abstract?

Cumulative evidence suggests that AIs are not equivalent in terms of potency of estrogen suppression and that there may be differences in clinical efficacy. Thus, with no data from head-to-head comparisons of the AIs as adjuvant therapy yet available, the question of whether there are efficacy differences between the AIs remains. To help answer this question, the Femara versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation (FACE) is a phase IIIb open-label, randomized, multicenter trial designed to test whether letrozole or anastrozole has superior efficacy as adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)- and lymph node-positive breast cancer. Eligible patients (target accrual, N=4,000) are randomized to receive either letrozole 2.5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg daily for up to 5 years. The primary objective is to compare disease-free survival at 5 years. Secondary end points include safety, overall survival, time to distant metastases, and time to contralateral breast cancer. The FACE trial will determine whether or not letrozole offers a greater clinical benefit to postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer at increased risk of early recurrence compared with anastrozole. trial 1258 0 trials[1258,]$title [1] \u0026quot;A decade of letrozole: FACE.\u0026quot;  Problem 2.1 - Preparing the Corpus Because we have both title and abstract information for trials, we need to build two corpera instead of one.

Moreover, the significances of the variables give us a way to gauge which variables are relevant for this prediction task. However, it is not immediately clear which variables are more important than the others, especially due to the large number of factor variables in this problem.\nLet’s now build a classification tree to predict “over50k”. Using the training set to build the model, and all of the other variables as independent variables.\nUsing the default parameters, so don’t set a value for minbucket or cp. Remember to specify method=“class” as an argument to rpart, since this is a classification problem. After you are done building the model, plot the resulting tree.\nHow many splits does the tree have in total?\nlibrary(rpart) library(rpart.plot) censusTree \u0026lt;- rpart(over50k ~ ., data = censusTrain, method=\u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) prp(censusTree) 4   Problem 2.2 - A CART Model Which variable does the tree split on at the first level (the very first split of the tree)? #### relationship\n Problem 2.3 - A CART Model Which variables does the tree split on at the second level (immediately after the first split of the tree)? #### capitalgain, education\n Problem 2.4 - A CART Model What is the accuracy of the model on the testing set?

(You can either add the argument type=“class”, or generate probabilities and use a threshold of 0.5 like in logistic regression.)\npredictTree \u0026lt;- as.vector(predict(censusTree, newdata = censusTest, type = \u0026quot;class\u0026quot;)) head(predictTree) [1] \u0026quot; \u0026gt;50K\u0026quot; \u0026quot; \u0026gt;50K\u0026quot; \u0026quot; \u0026lt;=50K\u0026quot; \u0026quot; \u0026lt;=50K\u0026quot; \u0026quot; \u0026lt;=50K\u0026quot; \u0026quot; \u0026gt;50K\u0026quot;  table(censusTest$over50k, predictTree)  predictTree \u0026lt;=50K \u0026gt;50K \u0026lt;=50K 9243 470 \u0026gt;50K 1482 1596 (9243 + 1596) / nrow(censusTest) [1] 0.8473927 This highlights a very regular phenomenon when comparing CART and logistic regression. CART often performs a little worse than logistic regression in out-of-sample accuracy. However, as is the case here, the CART model is often much simpler to describe and understand.\n Problem 2.5 - A CART Model Let’s now consider the ROC curve and AUC for the CART model on the test-set. I will need to get predicted probabilities for the observations in the test-set to build the ROC curve and compute the AUC. Remember that you can do this by removing the type=“class” argument when making predictions, and taking the second column of the resulting object.\npredictTreeProb \u0026lt;- predict(censusTree, newdata = censusTest) head(predictTreeProb)  \u0026lt;=50K \u0026gt;50K 2 0.2794982 0.72050176 5 0.2794982 0.72050176 7 0.9490143 0.05098572 8 0.6972807 0.30271934 11 0.6972807 0.30271934 12 0.2794982 0.72050176 head(predictTreeProb[, 2])  2 5 7 8 11 12 0.72050176 0.72050176 0.05098572 0.30271934 0.30271934 0.72050176  Plot the ROC curve for the CART model you have estimated. Observe that compared to the logistic regression ROC curve, the CART ROC curve is less smooth than the logistic regression ROC curve.\nWhich of the following explanations for this behavior is most correct? (HINT: Think about what the ROC curve is plotting and what changing the threshold does.)\nROCRpredTree = prediction(predictTreeProb[, 2], censusTest$over50k) ROCRperfTree = performance(ROCRpredTree, \u0026quot;tpr\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;fpr\u0026quot;) plot(ROCRperfTree) The probabilities from the CART model take only a handful of values (five, one for each end bucket/leaf of the tree); the changes in the ROC curve correspond to setting the threshold to one of those values.   Problem 2.6 - A CART Model What is the AUC of the CART model on the test-set?\nas.numeric(performance(ROCRpredTree, \u0026quot;auc\u0026quot;)@y.values) [1] 0.8470256  Problem 3.1 - A Random Forest Model Before building a random forest model, I’ll down-sample our training set. While some modern personal computers can build a random forest model on the entire training set, others might run out of memory when trying to train the model since random forests is much more computationally intensive than CART or Logistic Regression.\nFor this reason, before continuing I’ll define a new training set to be used when building our random forest model, that contains 2000 randomly selected obervations from the original training set.\nset.seed(1) trainSmall \u0026lt;- censusTrain[sample(nrow(censusTrain), 2000), ] Let’s now build a random forest model to predict “over50k”, using the dataset “trainSmall” as the data used to build the model. Set the seed to 1 again right before building the model, and use all of the other variables in the dataset as independent variables. (If you get an error that random forest “cannot handle categorical predictors with more than 32 categories”, re-build the model without the nativecountry variable as one of the independent variables.)\nlibrary(randomForest) randomForest 4.6-14 Type rfNews() to see new features/changes/bug fixes. set.seed(1) CensusForest \u0026lt;- randomForest(over50k ~ ., data = trainSmall) Then, make predictions using this model on the entire test-set.\nWhat is the accuracy of the model on the test-set, using a threshold of 0.5? (Remember that you don’t need a “type” argument when making predictions with a random forest model if you want to use a threshold of 0.5. Also, note that our accuracy might be different from the one reported here, since random forest models can still differ depending on our operating system, even when the random seed is set.)\npredictForest \u0026lt;- predict(CensusForest, newdata = censusTest) table(censusTest$over50k, predictForest)  predictForest \u0026lt;=50K \u0026gt;50K \u0026lt;=50K 8843 870 \u0026gt;50K 1029 2049 (9586 + 1093) / nrow(censusTest) [1] 0.8348839  Problem 3.2 - A Random Forest Model As we discussed, random forest models work by building a large collection of trees. As a result, we lose some of the interpretability that comes with CART in terms of seeing how predictions are made and which variables are important.\nHowever, we can still compute metrics that give us insight into which variables are important. One metric that we can look at is the number of times, aggregated over all of the trees in the random forest model, that a certain variable is selected for a split.\nTo view this metric, run the following lines of code (replace “MODEL” with the name of your random forest model):\nvu \u0026lt;- varUsed(CensusForest, count=TRUE) vusorted \u0026lt;- sort(vu, decreasing = FALSE, index.return = TRUE) dotchart(vusorted$x, names(CensusForest$forest$xlevels[vusorted$ix])) This code produces a chart that for each variable measures the number of times that variable was selected for splitting (the value on the x-axis).\nWhich of the following variables is the most important in terms of the number of splits? #### age\n Problem 3.3 - A Random Forest Model A different metric we can look at is related to “impurity”, which measures how homogenous each bucket or leaf of the tree is. In each tree in the forest, whenever we select a variable and perform a split, the impurity is decreased.\nTherefore, one way to measure the importance of a variable is to average the reduction in impurity, taken over all the times that variable is selected for splitting in all of the trees in the forest.\nTo compute this metric, run the following code (replace “MODEL” with the name of your random forest model):\nvarImpPlot(CensusForest) Which one of the following variables is the most important in terms of mean reduction in impurity? #### occupation\n Problem 4.1 - Selecting cp by Cross-Validation We now conclude our analysis of this dataset by looking at how CART behaves with different choices of its parameters. Let us select the cp parameter for our CART model using k-fold cross validation, with k = 10 folds. Do this by using the train function. Set the seed beforehand to 2. Test cp values from 0.002 to 0.1 in 0.002 increments.\nAlso, remember we using the entire training set “train” when building this model. The train function might take some time to run.\nWhich value of cp does the train function recommend?\nlibrary(caret) Loading required package: lattice Loading required package: ggplot2  Attaching package: \u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39; The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:randomForest\u0026#39;: margin library(e1071) # number of folds tr.control = trainControl(method = \u0026quot;cv\u0026quot;, number = 10) # cp values cartGrid \u0026lt;- expand.grid( .cp = seq(0.002,0.1,0.002)) cartGrid  .cp 1 0.002 2 0.004 3 0.006 4 0.008 5 0.010 6 0.012 7 0.014 8 0.016 9 0.018 10 0.020 11 0.022 12 0.024 13 0.026 14 0.028 15 0.030 16 0.032 17 0.034 18 0.036 19 0.038 20 0.040 21 0.042 22 0.044 23 0.046 24 0.048 25 0.050 26 0.052 27 0.054 28 0.056 29 0.058 30 0.060 31 0.062 32 0.064 33 0.066 34 0.068 35 0.070 36 0.072 37 0.074 38 0.076 39 0.078 40 0.080 41 0.082 42 0.084 43 0.086 44 0.088 45 0.090 46 0.092 47 0.094 48 0.096 49 0.098 50 0.100 # Cross-validation set.seed(2) tr = train(over50k ~ ., data = censusTrain, method = \u0026quot;rpart\u0026quot;, trControl = tr.control, tuneGrid = cartGrid) tr CART 19187 samples 12 predictor 2 classes: \u0026#39; \u0026lt;=50K\u0026#39;, \u0026#39; \u0026gt;50K\u0026#39; No pre-processing Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold) Summary of sample sizes: 17268, 17268, 17269, 17269, 17269, 17268, ...

By tuning cp, we improved our accuracy by over 1%, but our tree became significantly more complicated. In some applications, such an improvement in accuracy would be worth the loss in interpretability. In others, we may prefer a less accurate model that is simpler to understand and describe over a more accurate – but more complicated – model.\n ","date":1554681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554681600,"objectID":"0071f1f170734f4498f4ebc12f22bda6","permalink":"/project/earnings/earnings/","publishdate":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/earnings/earnings/","section":"project","summary":"Predict how much a person earns","tags":["R","Data Analytics","Machine Learning"],"title":"Earnings Prediction From Census Data","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" One of the earliest applications of predictive analytics methods applied so far was to automatically recognize letters, which post office machines use to sort mail. In this analysis, I’ll build a model that uses statistics of images of four letters in the Roman alphabet – A, B, P, and R – to predict which letter a particular image corresponds to.\nNote, that this is a multiclass classification problem. We have mostly focused on binary classification problems (e.g., predicting whether an individual voted or not, whether the Supreme Court will affirm or reverse a case, whether or not a person is at risk for a certain disease, etc.). In this problem, we have more than two classifications that are possible for each observation.\nThe file letters_ABPR.csv contains 3116 observations, each of which corresponds to a certain image of one of the four letters A, B, P and R. The images came from 20 different fonts, which were then randomly distorted to produce the final images; each such distorted image is represented as a collection of pixels, each of which is “on” or “off”.\nFor each such distorted image, we have available certain statistics of the image in terms of these pixels, as well as which of the four letters the image is. This data comes from the UCI ML Repository.\nThis dataset contains the following 17 variables:\n letter = the letter that the image corresponds to (A, B, P or R) xbox = the horizontal position of where the smallest box covering the letter shape begins. ybox = the vertical position of where the smallest box covering the letter shape begins. width = the width of this smallest box. height = the height of this smallest box. onpix = the total number of “on” pixels in the character image xbar = the mean horizontal position of all of the “on” pixels ybar = the mean vertical position of all of the “on” pixels x2bar = the mean squared horizontal position of all of the “on” pixels in the image y2bar = the mean squared vertical position of all of the “on” pixels in the image xybar = the mean of the product of the horizontal and vertical position of all of the “on” pixels in the image x2ybar = the mean of the product of the squared horizontal position and the vertical position of all of the “on” pixels xy2bar = the mean of the product of the horizontal position and the squared vertical position of all of the “on” pixels xedge = the mean number of edges (the number of times an “off” pixel is followed by an “on” pixel, or the image boundary is hit) as the image is scanned from left to right, along the whole vertical length of the image xedgeycor = the mean of the product of the number of horizontal edges at each vertical position and the vertical position yedge = the mean number of edges as the images is scanned from top to bottom, along the whole horizontal length of the image yedgexcor = the mean of the product of the number of vertical edges at each horizontal position and the horizontal position  Load the dataset letters \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;letters_ABPR.csv\u0026quot;) summary(letters)  letter xbox ybox width A:789 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 1.000 B:766 1st Qu.: 3.000 1st Qu.: 5.000 1st Qu.: 4.000 P:803 Median : 4.000 Median : 7.000 Median : 5.000 R:758 Mean : 3.915 Mean : 7.051 Mean : 5.186 3rd Qu.: 5.000 3rd Qu.: 9.000 3rd Qu.: 6.000 Max. :13.000 Max. :15.000 Max. :11.000 height onpix xbar ybar Min. : 0.000 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 3.000 Min. : 0.000 1st Qu.: 4.000 1st Qu.: 2.000 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.: 6.000 Median : 6.000 Median : 4.000 Median : 7.000 Median : 7.000 Mean : 5.276 Mean : 3.869 Mean : 7.469 Mean : 7.197 3rd Qu.: 7.000 3rd Qu.: 5.000 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.: 9.000 Max. :12.000 Max. :12.000 Max. :14.000 Max. :15.000 x2bar y2bar xybar x2ybar Min. : 0.000 Min. :0.000 Min. : 3.000 Min. : 0.00 1st Qu.: 3.000 1st Qu.:2.000 1st Qu.: 7.000 1st Qu.: 3.00 Median : 4.000 Median :4.000 Median : 8.000 Median : 5.00 Mean : 4.706 Mean :3.903 Mean : 8.491 Mean : 4.52 3rd Qu.: 6.000 3rd Qu.:5.000 3rd Qu.:10.000 3rd Qu.: 6.00 Max. :11.000 Max. :8.000 Max. :14.000 Max. :10.00 xy2bar xedge xedgeycor yedge Min. : 0.000 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 1.000 Min. : 0.0 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.: 2.000 1st Qu.: 7.000 1st Qu.: 3.0 Median : 7.000 Median : 2.000 Median : 8.000 Median : 4.0 Mean : 6.711 Mean : 2.913 Mean : 7.763 Mean : 4.6 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.: 4.000 3rd Qu.: 9.000 3rd Qu.: 6.0 Max. :14.000 Max. :10.000 Max. :13.000 Max. :12.0 yedgexcor Min. : 1.000 1st Qu.: 7.000 Median : 8.000 Mean : 8.418 3rd Qu.:10.000 Max. :13.000  str(letters) \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 3116 obs. of 17 variables: $ letter : Factor w/ 4 levels \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;B\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;P\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;R\u0026quot;: 2 1 4 2 3 4 4 1 3 3 ... $ xbox : int 4 1 5 5 3 8 2 3 8 6 ... $ ybox : int 2 1 9 9 6 10 6 7 14 10 ... $ width : int 5 3 5 7 4 8 4 5 7 8 ... $ height : int 4 2 7 7 4 6 4 5 8 8 ... $ onpix : int 4 1 6 10 2 6 3 3 4 7 ... $ xbar : int 8 8 6 9 4 7 6 12 5 8 ... $ ybar : int 7 2 11 8 14 7 7 2 10 5 ... $ x2bar : int 6 2 7 4 8 3 5 3 6 7 ... $ y2bar : int 6 2 3 4 1 5 5 2 3 5 ... $ xybar : int 7 8 7 6 11 8 6 10 12 7 ... $ x2ybar : int 6 2 3 8 6 4 5 2 5 6 ... $ xy2bar : int 6 8 9 6 3 8 7 9 4 6 ... $ xedge : int 2 1 2 6 0 6 3 2 4 3 ... $ xedgeycor: int 8 6 7 11 10 6 7 6 10 9 ... $ yedge : int 7 2 5 8 4 7 5 3 4 8 ... $ yedgexcor: int 10 7 11 7 8 7 8 8 8 9 ...  Problem 1.1 - Predicting B or not B Let’s warm up by attempting to predict just whether a letter is B or not. To begin, load the file letters_ABPR.csv into R, and call it letters. Then, create a new variable isB in the dataframe, which takes the value “TRUE” if the observation corresponds to the letter B, and “FALSE” if it does not.\nletters$isB \u0026lt;- as.factor(letters$letter == \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;) Now, split the dataset into a training and testing set, putting 50% of the data in the training set. Set the seed to 1000 before making the split. The first argument to sample.split should be the dependent variable “letters$isB”. Remember that TRUE values from sample.split should go in the training set.\nlibrary(caTools) set.seed(1000) lettersSplit = sample.split(letters$isB, SplitRatio = 0.5) lettersTrain = subset(letters, lettersSplit == TRUE) lettersTest = subset(letters, lettersSplit == FALSE) Before building models, let’s consider a baseline method that always predicts the most frequent outcome, which is “not B”.\nWhat is the accuracy of this baseline method on the test set?\ntable(letters$isB)  FALSE TRUE 2350 766  table(lettersTest$isB)  FALSE TRUE 1175 383  1175 / (1175 + 383) [1] 0.754172  Problem 1.2 - Predicting B or not B Now, build a classification tree to predict whether a letter is a B or not, using the training set to build the model. Remember to remove the variable “letter” out of the model, as this is related to what we are trying to predict!\nlibrary(rpart) library(rpart.plot) CARTb \u0026lt;- rpart(isB ~ . - letter, data = lettersTrain, method=\u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) We are just using the default parameters in our CART model, so we don’t need to add the minbucket or cp arguments at all. We also added the argument method=“class” since this is a classification problem.\nWhat is the accuracy of the CART model on the test-set? (Use type=“class” when making predictions on the test set.)\nbPredict \u0026lt;- predict(CARTb, newdata = lettersTest, type = \u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) table(lettersTest$isB, bPredict)  bPredict FALSE TRUE FALSE 1118 57 TRUE 43 340 (1126 + 342) / nrow(lettersTest) [1] 0.9422336  Problem 1.3 - Predicting B or Not B Now, build a random forest model to predict whether the letter is a B or not (the isB variable) using the training set. Using all of the other variables as independent variables, except letter (since it helped us define what we are trying to predict!). Using the default settings for ntree and nodesize (don’t include these arguments at all). Right before building the model, set the seed to 1000. (NOTE: You might get a slightly different answer on this problem, even if you set the random seed. This has to do with your operating system and the implementation of the random forest algorithm.)\nWhat is the accuracy of the model on the test set?\nbForestPredict \u0026lt;- predict(bForest, newdata = lettersTest, type = \u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) table(lettersTest$isB, bForestPredict)  bForestPredict FALSE TRUE FALSE 1163 12 TRUE 9 374 (1164 + 372) / nrow(lettersTest) [1] 0.9858793 Random forests tends to improve on CART in terms of predictive accuracy. Sometimes, this improvement can be quite significant, as it is here.\n Problem 2.1 - Predicting the letters A, B, P, R Let us now move on to the problem that we were originally interested in, which is to predict whether or not a letter is one of the four letters A, B, P or R.\nAs we saw earlier, building a multiclass classification CART model is no harder than building the models for binary classification problems. Fortunately, building a random forest model is just as easy. The variable in our dataframe which we will be trying to predict is “letter”.\nStart by converting letter in the original dataset (letters) to a factor by running the following code:\nletters$letter \u0026lt;- as.factor(letters$letter) Now, generate new training and testing sets of the letters dataframe using letters$letter as the first input to the sample.split function. Before splitting, set your seed to 2000. Again put 50% of the data in the training set. (Why do we need to split the data again? Remember that sample.split balances the outcome variable in the training and testing sets. With a new outcome variable, we want to re-generate our split.)\nset.seed(2000) lettersAllSplit \u0026lt;- sample.split(letters$letter, SplitRatio = 0.5) lettersAllTrain \u0026lt;- subset(letters, lettersAllSplit == TRUE) lettersAllTest \u0026lt;- subset(letters, lettersAllSplit == FALSE) In a multiclass classification problem, a simple baseline model is to predict the most frequent class of all of the options.\nWhat is the baseline accuracy on the testing set?\ntable(letters$letter)  A B P R 789 766 803 758  table(lettersAllTest$letter)  A B P R 395 383 401 379  401 / nrow(lettersAllTest) [1] 0.2573813 P is the most frequent class in the test set   Problem 2.2 - Predicting the letters A, B, P, R Now build a classification tree to predict “letter”, using the training set to build our model. You should use all of the other variables as independent variables, except “isB”, since it is related to what we are trying to predict!\nJust use the default parameters in your CART model. Add the argument method=“class” since this is a classification problem. Even though we have multiple classes here, nothing changes in how we build the model from the binary case.\nCARTletters \u0026lt;- rpart(letter ~ . - isB, data = lettersAllTrain, method=\u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) summary(CARTletters) Call: rpart(formula = letter ~ . - isB, data = lettersAllTrain, method = \u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) n= 1558 CP nsplit rel error xerror xstd 1 0.31920415 0 1.0000000 1.0346021 0.01442043 2 0.25865052 1 0.6807958 0.6323529 0.01704001 3 0.18685121 2 0.4221453 0.4238754 0.01585412 4 0.02595156 3 0.2352941 0.2370242 0.01299919 5 0.02076125 4 0.2093426 0.2162630 0.01253234 6 0.01730104 5 0.1885813 0.1980969 0.01209034 7 0.01384083 6 0.1712803 0.1894464 0.01186782 8 0.01211073 7 0.1574394 0.1678201 0.01127370 9 0.01000000 8 0.1453287 0.1608997 0.01107113 Variable importance ybar xedgeycor x2ybar xy2bar yedge y2bar xedge 17 16 14 12 11 8 7 xybar x2bar xbar 5 5 3 Node number 1: 1558 observations, complexity param=0.3192042 predicted class=P expected loss=0.7419769 P(node) =1 class counts: 394 383 402 379 probabilities: 0.253 0.246 0.258 0.243 left son=2 (1088 obs) right son=3 (470 obs) Primary splits: xedgeycor \u0026lt;

The first is that it is significantly higher than the value for CART, highlighting the gain in accuracy that is possible from using random forest models.\nThe second is that while the accuracy of CART decreased significantly as we transitioned from the problem of predicting B or not B (a relatively simple problem) to the problem of predicting the four letters (certainly a harder problem), the accuracy of the random forest model decreased by a tiny amount.\n ","date":1554681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554681600,"objectID":"4066379bd08c6aafc0d70b3f118f9193","permalink":"/project/letter_recognition/letters/","publishdate":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/letter_recognition/letters/","section":"project","summary":"Predict which letter a particular image corresponds to","tags":["R","Data Analytics","Machine Learning"],"title":"Letter Reecognition","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In August 2006 three researchers (Alan Gerber and Donald Green of Yale University, and Christopher Larimer of the University of Northern Iowa) carried out a large scale field experiment in Michigan, USA to test the hypothesis that one of the reasons people vote is social, or extrinsic, pressure.\nTo quote the first paragraph of their 2008 research paper:\n “Among the most striking features of a democratic political system is the participation of millions of voters in elections. Why do large numbers of people vote, despite the fact that …”the casting of a single vote is of no significance where there is a multitude of electors“? One hypothesis is adherence to social norms. Voting is widely regarded as a citizen duty, and citizens worry that others will think less of them if they fail to participate in elections. Voters’ sense of civic duty has long been a leading explanation of voters turnout…”  In this analysis, I’ll use both logistic regression and classification trees to analyze the data they collected.\nThe data The researchers grouped about 344,000 voters into different groups randomly - about 191,000 voters were a “control” group, and the rest were categorized into one of four “treatment” groups. These five groups correspond to five binary variables in the dataset.\n“Civic Duty” (variable civicduty) group members were sent a letter that simply said “DO YOUR CIVIC DUTY - VOTE!” “Hawthorne Effect” (variable hawthorne) group members were sent a letter that had the “Civic Duty” message plus the additional message “YOU ARE BEING STUDIED” and they were informed that their voting behavior would be examined by means of public records. “Self” (variable self) group members received the “Civic Duty” message as well as the recent voting record of everyone in that household and a message stating that another message would be sent after the election with updated records. “Neighbors” (variable neighbors) group members were given the same message as that for the “Self” group, except the message not only had the household voting records but, also that of neighbors - maximizing social pressure. “Control” (variable control) group members were not sent anything, and represented the typical voting situation.  Additional variables include sex (0 for male, 1 for female), yob (year of birth), and the dependent variable voting (1 if they voted, 0 otherwise).\n Problem 1.1 - Exploration and Logistic Regression We will first get familiar with the data.\nWhat proportion of people in this dataset voted in this election?\ngerber \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;gerber.csv\u0026quot;) str(gerber) \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 344084 obs. of 8 variables: $ sex : int 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 ... $ yob : int 1941 1947 1982 1950 1951 1959 1956 1981 1968 1967 ... $ voting : int 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 ... $ hawthorne: int 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ civicduty: int 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ neighbors: int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ self : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ control : int 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 ... table(gerber$voting)  0 1 235388 108696  108696 / (235388 + 108696) [1] 0.3158996  Problem 1.2 - Exploration and Logistic Regression Which of the four “treatment groups” had the largest percentage of people who actually voted (voting = 1)?\n# howthorne table(gerber$voting, gerber$hawthorne)  0 1 0 209500 25888 1 96380 12316 12316 / (25888 + 12316) [1] 0.3223746 # civicduty table(gerber$voting, gerber$civicduty)  0 1 0 209191 26197 1 96675 12021 12021 / (26197 + 12021) [1] 0.3145377 # neighbors table(gerber$voting, gerber$neighbors)  0 1 0 211625 23763 1 94258 14438 14438 / (23763 + 14438) [1] 0.3779482 # self table(gerber$voting, gerber$self)  0 1 0 210361 25027 1 95505 13191 13191 / (25027 + 13191) [1] 0.3451515 Neighbors   Problem 1.3 - Exploration and Logistic Regression Build a logistic regression model for voting using the four treatment group variables as the independent variables (civicduty, hawthorne, self, and neighbors).

Problem 2.1 - Trees I’ll now try out trees! Building a CART tree for voting using all data and the same four treatment variables we used before. Don’t set the option method=“class” - we are actually going to create a regression tree here.\nWe are interested in building a tree to explore the fraction of people who vote, or the probability of voting.\nI’d like CART to split our groups if they have different probabilities of voting. If we used method=‘class’, CART would only split if one of the groups had a probability of voting above 50% and the other had a probability of voting less than 50% (since the predicted outcomes would be different).\nHowever, with regression trees, CART will split even if both groups have probability less than 50%. Leave all the parameters at their default values.\nlibrary(rpart) library(rpart.plot) CARTmodel \u0026lt;- rpart(voting ~ civicduty + hawthorne + self + neighbors, data = gerber) # plot the tree. What happens, and if relevant, why? prp(CARTmodel) No variables are used (the tree is only a root node) - none of the variables make a big enough effect to be split on.   Problem 2.2 - Trees Now build the tree:\nCARTmodel2 \u0026lt;- rpart(voting ~ civicduty + hawthorne + self + neighbors, data=gerber, cp=0.0) prp(CARTmodel2) What do we observe about the order of the splits? #### Neighbor is the first split, civic duty is the last.\n Problem 2.3 - Trees Using only the CART tree plot, we note that the fraction (a number between 0 and 1) of “Civic Duty” people voted amounted to: #### 31%\n Problem 2.4 - Trees Building a new tree that includes the “sex” variable, again with cp = 0.0. Notice that sex appears as a split that is of secondary importance to the treatment group.\nCARTmodel3 \u0026lt;- rpart(voting ~ civicduty + hawthorne + self + neighbors + sex, data=gerber, cp=0.0) prp(CARTmodel3) In the control group, which gender is more likely to vote? #### Men (0)\nIn the “Civic Duty” group, which gender is more likely to vote? #### Men (0)\n Problem 3.1 - Interaction Terms We know trees can handle “nonlinear” relationships, e.g. “in the ‘Civic Duty’ group and female”, but as we will see in the next few questions, it is possible to do the same for logistic regression.\nFirstly, let’s explore what trees can tell us. Let’s just focus on the “Control” treatment group. Creating a regression tree using just the “control” variable, then creating another tree with the “control” and “sex” variables, both with cp=0.0.\nCARTcontrol \u0026lt;- rpart(voting ~ control, data = gerber, cp = 0.0) CARTcontrolAndSex \u0026lt;- rpart(voting ~ control + sex, data = gerber, cp = 0.0) In the “control” only tree, what is the absolute value of the difference in the predicted probability of voting between being in the control group versus being in a different group?\nUsing the absolute value function to get an answer, i.e. abs(Control Prediction - Non-Control Prediction). I’ll add the argument “digits = 6” to the prp code to get a more accurate estimate.\nprp(CARTcontrol, digits = 6) abs(0.296638 - 0.34) [1] 0.043362 0.043362   Problem 3.2 - Interaction Terms Now, using the second tree (with control and sex), determine who is affected more by NOT being in the control group (being in any of the four treatment groups):\nprp(CARTcontrolAndSex, digits = 6) They are affected about the same (change in probability within 0.001 of each other).   Problem 3.3 - Interaction Terms Going back to logistic regression now, I’ll build a model using “sex” and “control”. Interpreting the coefficient for “sex”:\nVotingControlAndSexLog \u0026lt;- glm(voting ~ control + sex, data = gerber, family = binomial) summary(VotingControlAndSexLog)  Call: glm(formula = voting ~ control + sex, family = binomial, data = gerber) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.9220 -0.9012 -0.8290 1.4564 1.5717 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Problem 3.4 - Interaction Terms The regression tree calculated the percentage voting exactly for every one of the four possibilities (Man, Not Control), (Man, Control), (Woman, Not Control), (Woman, Control).\nLogistic regression has attempted to do the same, although it wasn’t able to do as well because it can’t consider exactly the joint possibility of being a women and in the control group.\nI can quantify this precisely. By creating the following dataframe (this contains all of the possible values of sex and control), and evaluating our logistic regression using the predict function (where “LogModelSex” is the name of our logistic regression model that uses both control and sex):\nPossibilities \u0026lt;- data.frame(sex=c(0,0,1,1), control=c(0,1,0,1)) predict(VotingControlAndSexLog, newdata=Possibilities, type=\u0026quot;response\u0026quot;)  1 2 3 4 0.3462559 0.3024455 0.3337375 0.2908065  The four values in the results correspond to the four possibilities in the order they are stated above ( (Man, Not Control), (Man, Control), (Woman, Not Control), (Woman, Control) ).\nWhat is the absolute difference between the tree and the logistic regression for the (Woman, Control) case?\nThe answer contains five numbers after the decimal point.\nabs(0.290456 - 0.2908065) [1] 0.0003505 round(0.0003505, digits = 5) [1] 0.00035  Problem 3.5 - Interaction Terms So the difference is not too big for this dataset, but it’s there. I’m going to add a new term to our logistic regression now, that is the combination of the “sex” and “control” variables - so if this new variable is 1, that means the person is a woman AND in the control group.\nLogModel2 \u0026lt;- glm(voting ~ sex + control + sex:control, data = gerber, family = \u0026quot;binomial\u0026quot;) How do I interpret the coefficient for the new variable in isolation?

One of the consequences of being editable by anyone is that some people vandalize pages.\nThis can take the form of removing content, adding promotional or inappropriate content, or more subtle shifts that change the meaning of the article.\nWith these many articles and edits per day it is difficult for humans to detect all instances of vandalism and revert (undo) them. As a result, Wikipedia uses bots - computer programs that automatically revert edits that look like vandalism. In this analysis I’ll attempt to develop a vandalism detector that uses ML to distinguish between a valid edit and vandalism.\nThe data for this analysis is based on the revision history of the page Language. Wikipedia provides a history for each page that consists of the state of the page at each revision. Rather than manually considering each revision, a script was run that checked whether edits stayed or were reverted. If a change was eventually reverted then that revision is marked as vandalism. This may result in some misclassifications, but the script performs well enough for our needs.\nAs a result of this preprocessing, some common processing tasks have already been done, including lower-casing and punctuation removal. The columns in the dataset are:\n Vandal = 1 if this edit was vandalism, 0 if not. Minor = 1 if the user marked this edit as a “minor edit”, 0 if not. Loggedin = 1 if the user made this edit while using a Wikipedia account, 0 if they did not. Added = The unique words added. Removed = The unique words removed.  Notice the repeated use of unique. The data we have available is not the traditional bag of words - rather it is the set of words that were removed or added. For example, if a word was removed multiple times in a revision it will only appear one time in the “Removed” column.\nLoading the packages # install packages if necessary list.of.packages \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;SnowballC\u0026quot;) new.packages \u0026lt;- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,\u0026quot;Package\u0026quot;])] if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages) ## load packages library(tm) Loading required package: NLP library(SnowballC) library(caTools) # to use sample.split function. library(rpart) library(rpart.plot) library(ROCR) Loading required package: gplots  Attaching package: \u0026#39;gplots\u0026#39; The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:stats\u0026#39;: lowess Problem 1.1 - Bags of Words Load the data wiki.csv with the option stringsAsFactors=FALSE, calling the dataframe “wiki”.

More specifically, the words themselves were not useful. There are other options though, and in this section we will try two techniques - identifying a key class of words, and counting words. The key class of words we will use are website addresses. “Website addresses” (also known as URLs - Uniform Resource Locators) are comprised of two main parts. An example would be “http://www.google.com”. The first part is the protocol, which is usually “http” (HyperText Transfer Protocol). The second part is the address of the site, e.g. “www.google.com”.\nWe have stripped all punctuation so links to websites appear in the data as one word, e.g. “httpwwwgooglecom”. We hypothesize that given, given that a lot of vandalism seems to be adding links to promotional or irrelevant websites. The presence of a web address is a sign of vandalism. We can search for the presence of a web address in the words added by searching for “http” in the Added column. The grepl function returns TRUE if a string is found in another string, e.g. * grepl(“cat”,“dogs and cats”,fixed=TRUE) # TRUE * grepl(“cat”,“dogs and rats”,fixed=TRUE) # FALSE\nCreate a copy of your dataframe from the previous question:\nwikiWords2 \u0026lt;- wikiWords # make a new column in wikiWords2 that is 1 if \u0026quot;http\u0026quot; was in Added: wikiWords2$HTTP \u0026lt;- ifelse(grepl(\u0026quot;http\u0026quot;, wiki$Added, fixed = TRUE), 1, 0) # based on this new column, how many revisions added a link? table(wikiWords2$HTTP)  0 1 3659 217  217   Problem 2.2 - Problem-Specific Knowledge In problem 1.5, you computed a vector called “spl” that identified the observations to put in the training and testing sets.

We already have a word count available in the form of the document-term matrices (DTMs).

If the borrower repays the loan, then the lender profits from the interest. However, if the borrower is unable to repay the loan, then the lender loses money. Therefore, lenders face the problem of predicting the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan.\nTo address this analysis, I’ll use publicly available data from LendingClub.com, a website that connects borrowers and investors over the Internet. This dataset represents 9,578 3-year loans that were funded through the LendingClub.com platform between May 2007 and February 2010.\nThe binary dependent variable not.fully.paid indicates that the loan was not paid back in full (the borrower either defaulted or the loan was “charged off,” meaning the borrower was deemed unlikely to ever pay it back).\nTo predict this dependent variable, I’ll use the following independent variables available to the investor when deciding whether to fund a loan:\n credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise. purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values “credit_card”, “debt_consolidation”, “educational”, “major_purchase”, “small_business”, and “all_other”). int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates. installment: The monthly installments ($) owed by the borrower if the loan is funded. log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower. dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income). fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower. days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line. revol.bal: The borrower’s revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle). revol.util: The borrower’s revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available). inq.last.6mths: The borrower’s number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months. delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years. pub.rec: The borrower’s number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).

Problem 1.4 - Preparing the Dataset For the rest of this problem, I’ll be using a revised version of the dataset that has the missing values filled in with multiple imputation. To ensure everybody has the same dataframe going forward, you can either run the code below in your R console (if you haven’t already, run the code install.packages(“mice”) first), or you can download and load into R the dataset we created after running the imputation: loans_imputed.csv.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: On certain operating systems, the imputation results are not the same even if you set the random seed. If you decide to do the imputation yourself, please still read the provided imputed dataset (loans_imputed.csv) into R and compare your results, using the summary function. If the results are different, please make sure to use the data in loans_imputed.csv for the rest of the problem.\n library(mice) set.seed(144) vars.for.imputation = setdiff(names(loans), “not.fully.paid”) imputed = complete(mice(loans[vars.for.imputation])) loans[vars.for.imputation] = imputed  loans \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;loans_imputed.csv\u0026quot;) Note, that to do this imputation, we set vars.for.imputation to all variables in the dataframe except for not.fully.paid, to impute the values using all of the other independent variables.\nWhat best describes the process we just used to handle missing values? #### We predicted missing variable values using the available independent variables for each observation.\n Problem 2.1 - Prediction Models Now that we have prepared the dataset, we need to split it into a training and testing set. To ensure everybody obtains the same split, set the random seed to 144 (even though you already did so earlier in the problem) and use the sample.split function to select the 70% of observations for the training set (the dependent variable for sample.split is not.fully.paid). Name the dataframes train and test.\nset.seed(144) split = sample.split(loans$not.fully.paid, SplitRatio = 0.7) train = subset(loans, split == TRUE) test = subset(loans, split == FALSE) Now, use logistic regression trained on the training set to predict the dependent variable not.fully.paid using all the independent variables.\nLoansLog \u0026lt;- glm(not.fully.paid ~ ., data = train, family = binomial) Which independent variables are significant in our model?

However, LendingClub.com assigns the interest rate to a loan based on their estimate of that loan’s risk.\nThis variable, int.rate, is an independent variable in our dataset. In this part, we will investigate using the loan’s interest rate as a “smart baseline” to order the loans according to risk.\nUsing the training set, build a bivariate logistic regression model (aka a logistic regression model with a single independent variable) that predicts the dependent variable not.fully.paid using only the variable int.rate.\nLoansLog2 \u0026lt;- glm(not.fully.paid ~ int.rate, data = train, family = binomial) summary(LoansLog2)  Call: glm(formula = not.fully.paid ~ int.rate, family = binomial, data = train) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0547 -0.6271 -0.5442 -0.4361 2.2914 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

However, if the loan is not paid back, the investor loses the money invested. Therefore, the investor should seek loans that best balance this risk and reward.\nTo compute interest revenue, consider a $c investment in a loan that has an annual interest rate r over a period of t years.\nUsing continuous compounding of interest, this investment pays back c * exp(rt) dollars by the end of the t years, where exp(rt) is e raised to the r*t power.\nHow much does a $10 investment with an annual interest rate of 6% pay back after 3 years, using continuous compounding of interest? Hint: remember to convert the percentage to a proportion before doing the math.\n10 * exp(0.06 * 3) [1] 11.97217  Problem 4.2 - Computing the Profitability of an Investment While the investment has value c * exp(rt) dollars after collecting interest, the investor had to pay $c for the investment.\nWhat is the profit to the investor if the investment is paid back in full?\n10 * exp(0.06 * 3) - 10 [1] 1.972174  Problem 4.3 - Computing the Profitability of an Investment Now, consider the case where the investor made a $c investment, but it was not paid back in full. Assume, conservatively, that no money was received from the borrower (often a lender will receive some but not all of the value of the loan, making this a pessimistic assumption of how much is received).\nWhat is the loss to the investor in this scenario? #### -10\n Problem 5.1 - A Simple Investment Strategy In the previous subproblem, we concluded that an investor who invested c dollars in a loan with interest rate r for t years makes c * (exp(rt) - 1) dollars of profit if the loan is paid back in full and -c dollars of profit if the loan is not paid back in full (pessimistically).\nIn order to evaluate the quality of an investment strategy, we need to compute this profit for each loan in the test-set.\nFor this variable, we will assume a $1 investment (aka c=1). To create the variable, we first assign to the profit for a fully paid loan, exp(rt)-1, to every observation, and we then replace this value with -1 in the cases where the loan was not paid in full.\nAll the loans in our dataset are 3-year loans, meaning t=3 in our calculations.\ntest$profit = exp(test$int.rate*3) - 1 test$profit[test$not.fully.paid == 1] = -1 What is the maximum profit of a $10 investment in any loan in the testing set?\nmax(test$profit) * 10 [1] 8.894769  Problem 6.1 - An Investment Strategy Based on Risk A simple investment strategy of equally investing in all the loans would yield profit $20.94 for a $100 investment. But this simple investment strategy does not leverage the prediction model we built earlier in this problem.\nAs stated earlier, investors seek loans that balance reward with risk, in that they simultaneously have high interest rates and a low risk of not being paid back.\nTo meet this objective, I’ll analyze an investment strategy in which the investor only purchases loans with a high interest rate (a rate of at least 15%), but amongst these loans selects the ones with the lowest predicted risk of not being paid back in full.\nWe will model an investor who invests $1 in each of the most promising 100 loans.\nFirst, use the subset() function to build a dataframe called highInterest consisting of the test-set loans with an interest rate of at least 15%.\nhighInterest \u0026lt;- subset(test, int.rate \u0026gt;= 0.15) What is the average profit of a $1 investment in one of these high-interest loans?\nmean(highInterest$profit) [1] 0.2251015 What proportion of the high-interest loans were not paid back in full?\ntable(highInterest$not.fully.paid)  0 1 327 110  110 / (327 + 110) [1] 0.2517162  Problem 6.2 - An Investment Strategy Based on Risk Next, I’ll determine the 100th smallest predicted probability of not paying in full by sorting the predicted risks in increasing order and selecting the 100th element of this sorted list.\ncutoff = sort(highInterest$predicted.risk, decreasing=FALSE)[100] cutoff [1] 0.1763305 Use the subset() function to build a dataframe called selectedLoans consisting of the high-interest loans with predicted risk not exceeding the cut-off we just computed.

Although the logistic regression models developed in this analysis did not have large AUC values, we see that they still provided the edge needed to improve the profitability of an investment portfolio.\nWe conclude with a note of warning. Throughout this analysis I’ve assume that the loans we invest in will perform in the same way as the loans we used to train our model, even though our training set covers a relatively short period of time. If there is an economic shock like a large financial downturn, default rates might be significantly higher than those observed in the training set and we might end up losing money instead of profiting. Investors must pay careful attention to such risk when making investment decisions.\n ","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"71ca679d3bab7188324ce724fa8dc839","permalink":"/project/loan_repayment/loan_repayments/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/loan_repayment/loan_repayments/","section":"project","summary":"Predict the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan","tags":["R","Data Analytics","Machine Learning"],"title":"Predict Loan Repayments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In many criminal justice systems around the world, inmates deemed not to be a threat to society are released from prison under the parole system prior to completing their sentence. They are still considered to be serving their sentence while on parole, and they can be returned to prison if they violate the terms of their parole.\nParole boards are charged with identifying which inmates are good candidates for release on parole. They seek to release inmates who will not commit additional crimes after release. In this analysis, I’ll build and validate a model that predicts if an inmate will violate the terms of his or her parole.\nSuch a model could be useful to a parole board when deciding to approve or deny an application for parole.\nFor this prediction task, I’ll use data from the U.S 2004 National Corrections Reporting Program, a nationwide census of parole releases that occurred during 2004.\nI’ve limited my focus to parolees who served no more than 6 months in prison and whose maximum sentence for all charges did not exceed 18 months.\nThe dataset contains all such parolees who either successfully completed their term of parole during 2004 or those who violated the terms of their parole during that year. The dataset contains the following variables:\n male: 1 if the parolee is male, 0 if female race: 1 if the parolee is white, 2 otherwise age: the parolee’s age (in years) when he or she was released from prison state: a code for the parolee’s state. 2 is Kentucky, 3 is Louisiana, 4 is Virginia, and 1 is any other state. The three states were selected due to having a high representation in the dataset. time.served: the number of months the parolee served in prison (limited by the inclusion criteria to not exceed 6 months). max.sentence: the maximum sentence length for all charges, in months (limited by the inclusion criteria to not exceed 18 months). multiple.offenses: 1 if the parolee was incarcerated for multiple offenses, 0 otherwise. crime: a code for the parolee’s main crime leading to incarceration. 2 is larceny, 3 is drug-related crime, 4 is driving-related crime, and 1 is any other crime. violator: 1 if the parolee violated the parole, and 0 if the parolee completed the parole without violation.

The following two properties might be useful to you when exploring this question:\nIf we have a coefficient c for a variable, then that means the log odds (or Logit) are increased by c for a unit increase in the variable. If we have a coefficient c for a variable, then that means the odds are multiplied by e^c for a unit increase in the variable.  exp(1.6119919) [1] 5.012786 Our model predicts that a parolee who committed multiple offenses has 5.01 times higher odds of being a violator than a parolee who did not commit multiple offenses but, is otherwise identical.\n Problem 3.3 - Building a Logistic Regression Model Consider a parolee who is male, of white race, aged 50 years at prison release, from the state of Maryland, served 3 months, had a maximum sentence of 12 months, did not commit multiple offenses, and committed a larceny.\nExplore the following questions based on the model’s predictions for this individual.

It is always important to evaluate a dataset for possible sources of bias.\nThe dataset contains all individuals released from parole in 2004, either due to completing their parole term or violating the terms of their parole. However, it does not contain parolees who neither violated their parole nor completed their term in 2004, causing non-violators to be underrepresented.\nThis is called “selection bias” or “selecting on the dependent variable,” because only a subset of all relevant parolees were included in our analysis, based on our dependent variable in this analysis (parole violation).\nHow could we improve our dataset to best address selection bias? #### We should use a dataset tracking a group of parolees from the start of their parole until either they violated parole or they completed their term.\n ","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"a08232a5d5fe79172edf0f14ceff9d3c","permalink":"/project/parole_violators/parole_violators/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/parole_violators/parole_violators/","section":"project","summary":"Predict if an inmate will violate his or her terms of parole","tags":["R","Data Analytics","Machine Learning"],"title":"Predict Parole Violators","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Popularity of music records\nThe music industry has a well-developed market with a global annual revenue around $15 billion. The recording industry is highly competitive and is dominated by three big production companies which make up nearly 82% of the total annual album sales.\nArtists are at the core of the music industry and record labels provide them with the necessary resources to sell their music on a large scale. A record label incurs numerous costs (studio recording, marketing, distribution, and touring) in exchange for a percentage of the profits from album sales, singles and concert tickets.\nUnfortunately, the success of an artist’s release is highly uncertain: a single may be extremely popular, resulting in widespread radio play and digital downloads, while another single may turn out quite unpopular, and therefore unprofitable.\nKnowing the competitive nature of the recording industry, record labels face the fundamental decision problem of which musical releases to support to maximize their financial success.\nHow can we use analytics to predict the popularity of a song? In this project, we challenge ourselves to predict whether a song will reach a spot in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.\nTaking an analytics approach, we aim to use information about a song’s properties to predict its popularity. The dataset songs.csv consists of all songs which made it to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart from 1990-2010 plus a sample of additional songs that didn’t make the Top 10. This data comes from three sources: Wikipedia, Billboard.com, and EchoNest.\nThe variables included in the dataset either describe the artist or the song, or they are associated with the following song attributes: time signature, loudness, key, pitch, tempo, and timbre.\nHere’s a detailed description of the variables:\n year = the year the song was released songtitle = the title of the song artistname = the name of the artist of the song songID and artistID = identifying variables for the song and artist timesignature and timesignature_confidence = a variable estimating the time signature of the song, and the confidence in the estimate loudness = a continuous variable indicating the average amplitude of the audio in decibels tempo and tempo_confidence = a variable indicating the estimated beats per minute of the song, and the confidence in the estimate key and key_confidence = a variable with twelve levels indicating the estimated key of the song (C, C#, . . ., B), and the confidence in the estimate energy = a variable that represents the overall acoustic energy of the song, using a mix of features such as loudness pitch = a continuous variable that indicates the pitch of the song timbre_0_min, timbre_0_max, timbre_1_min, timbre_1_max, . . . , timbre_11_min, and timbre_11_max = variables that indicate the minimum/maximum values over all segments for each of the twelve values in the timbre vector (resulting in 24 continuous variables) Top10 = a binary variable indicating whether or not the song made it to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart (1 if it was in the top 10, and 0 if it was not)  Problem 1.1 - Understanding the Data Use the read.csv function to load the dataset “songs.csv” into R.

Zumbi Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’\n Problem 2.1 - Creating Our Prediction Model We wish to predict whether or not a song will make it to the Top 10. To do this, first use the subset function to split the data into a training set “SongsTrain” consisting of all the observations up to and including 2009 song releases, and a testing set “SongsTest”, consisting of the 2010 song releases.\nHow many observations (songs) are in the training set?\nSongsTrain \u0026lt;- subset(songs, year \u0026lt;= 2009) SongsTest \u0026lt;- subset(songs, year == 2010) nrow(songs) [1] 7574 nrow(SongsTrain) + nrow(SongsTest) [1] 7574  Problem 2.2 - Creating our Prediction Model In this problem, our outcome variable is “Top10” - we are trying to predict whether or not a song will make it to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.\nSince the outcome variable is binary, we will build a logistic regression model. We’ll start by using all song attributes as our independent variables, which we’ll call Model 1. We will only use the variables in our dataset that describe the numerical attributes of the song in our logistic regression model.\nSo we won’t use the variables “year”, “songtitle”, “artistname”, “songID” or “artistID”. We have seen in the lecture that, to build the logistic regression model, we would normally explicitly input the formula including all the independent variables in R. However, in this case, this is a tedious amount of work since we have a large number of independent variables. There is a nice trick to avoid doing so. Let’s suppose that, except for the outcome variable Top10, all other variables in the training set are inputs to Model 1. Then, we can use the formula SongsLog1 = glm(Top10 ~ ., data=SongsTrain, family=binomial) to build our model. Notice that the “.” is used in place of enumerating all the independent variables. (Also, keep in mind that you can choose to put quotes around binomial, or leave out the quotes. R can understand this argument either way.) However, in our case, we want to exclude some of the variables in our dataset from being used as independent variables (“year”, “songtitle”, “artistname”, “songID”, and “artistID”).\nTo do this, we can use the following trick. First define a vector of variable names called nonvars - these are the variables that we won’t use in our model.\nnonvars = c(\u0026quot;year\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;songtitle\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;artistname\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;songID\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;artistID\u0026quot;) To remove these variables from our training and testing sets.\nSongsTrain = SongsTrain[ , !(names(SongsTrain) %in% nonvars) ] SongsTest = SongsTest[ , !(names(SongsTest) %in% nonvars) ] Now, use the glm function to build a logistic regression model to predict Top10 using all of the other variables as the independent variables. You should use SongsTrain to build the model.\nLooking at the summary of your model, what is the value of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)?\nSongsLog1 \u0026lt;- glm(Top10 ~ ., data = SongsTrain, family=binomial) summary(SongsLog1)  Call: glm(formula = Top10 ~ ., family = binomial, data = SongsTrain) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.9220 -0.5399 -0.3459 -0.1845 3.0770 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Our model seems to indicate that these confidence variables are significant (rather than the variables timesignature, key and tempo themselves). What does the model suggest? #### The higher our confidence about time signature, key and tempo, the more likely the song is to be in the Top 10\n Problem 2.4 - Creating Our Prediction Model In general, if the confidence is low for the time signature, tempo, and key, then the song is more likely to be complex.\nWhat does Model 1 suggest in terms of complexity? #### Mainstream listeners tend to prefer less complex songs\n Problem 2.5 - Creating Our Prediction Model Songs with heavier instrumentation tend to be louder (have higher values in the variable “loudness”) and more energetic (have higher values in the variable “energy”). By inspecting the coefficient of the variable “loudness”, what does Model 1 suggest? #### Mainstream listeners prefer songs with heavy instrumentation\nBy inspecting the coefficient of the variable “energy”, do we draw the same conclusions as above? #### No\n Problem 3.1 - Beware of Multicollinearity Issues! What is the correlation between the variables “loudness” and “energy” in the training set?\ncor(SongsTrain$loudness, SongsTrain$energy) [1] 0.7399067 Given that these two variables are highly correlated, Model 1 suffers from multicollinearity. To avoid this issue, we will omit one of these two variables and re-run the logistic regression.\nIn the rest of this problem, we’ll build two variations of our original model: Model 2, in which we keep “energy” and omit “loudness”, and Model 3, in which we keep “loudness” and omit “energy”.\n Problem 3.2 - Beware of Multicollinearity Issues! Create Model 2, which is Model 1 without the independent variable “loudness”.\nSongsLog2 = glm(Top10 ~ . - loudness, data=SongsTrain, family=binomial) We just subtracted the variable loudness. We couldn’t do this with the variables “songtitle” and “artistname”, because they are not numeric variables, and we might get different values in the test-set that the training set has never seen.

What is the accuracy of Model 3 on the test-set, using a threshold of 0.45? (Compute the accuracy as a number between 0 and 1.)\npredSongsTest = predict(SongsLog3, type=\u0026quot;response\u0026quot;, newdata = SongsTest) table(SongsTest$Top10, predSongsTest \u0026gt; 0.45)  FALSE TRUE 0 309 5 1 40 19 (309 + 19) / nrow(SongsTest) [1] 0.8793566  Problem 4.2 - Validating Our Model Let’s check if there’s any incremental benefit in using Model 3 instead of a baseline model. Given the difficulty of guessing which song is going to be a hit, an easier model would be to pick the most frequent outcome (a song is not a Top 10 hit) for all songs.\nWhat would the accuracy of the baseline model be on the test-set?\ntable(SongsTest$Top10)  0 1 314 59  314/(314 + 59) [1] 0.8418231  Problem 4.3 - Validating Our Model It seems that Model 3 gives us a small improvement over the baseline model. Still, does it create an edge? Let’s view the two models from an investment perspective. A production company is interested in investing in songs that are highly likely to make it to the Top 10. The company’s objective is to minimize its risk of financial losses attributed to investing in songs that end up unpopular.\nA competitive edge can therefore be achieved if we can provide the production company a list of songs that are highly likely to end up in the Top 10. We note that the baseline model does not prove useful, as it simply does not label any song as a hit. Let us see what our model has to offer.\nHow many songs does Model 3 correctly predict as Top 10 hits in 2010 (remember that all songs in 2010 went into our test set), using a threshold of 0.45?\ntable(SongsTest$Top10, predSongsTest \u0026gt; 0.45)  FALSE TRUE 0 309 5 1 40 19 19\nHow many non-hit songs does Model 3 predict will be Top 10 hits (again, looking at the test set), using a threshold of 0.45? #### 5\n Problem 4.4 - Validating Our Model # what is the sensitivity of Model 3 on the test set, using a threshold of 0.45? 19 / (40 + 19) [1] 0.3220339 # what is the specificity of Model 3 on the test set, using a threshold of 0.45? 309 / (309 + 5) [1] 0.9840764  Conclusions  Model 3 favors specificity over sensitivity. Model 3 provides conservative predictions, and predicts that a song will make it to the Top 10 very rarely. So while it detects less than half of the Top 10 songs, we can be very confident in the songs that it does predict to be Top 10 hits.

According to the National Vital Statistics Reports published in October 2012, influenza ranked as the eighth leading cause of death in 2011 in the U.S. Each year, 250,000 to 500,000 deaths are attributed to influenza related diseases throughout the world.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) detect influenza activity through virologic and clinical data, including Influenza-like Illness (ILI) physician visits. Reporting national and regional data, however, are published with a 1-2 week lag.\nThe Google Flu Trends project was initiated to see if faster reporting can be made possible by considering flu-related online search queries – data that is available almost immediately.\nI would like to estimate influenza-like illness (ILI) activity using Google web search logs. Fortunately, one can easily access this data online:\n ILI Data - The CDC publishes on its website the official regional and state-level percentage of patient visits to healthcare providers for ILI purposes on a weekly basis. Google Search Queries - Google Trends allows public retrieval of weekly counts for every query searched by users around the world.  For each location, the counts are normalized by dividing the count for each query in a particular week by the total number of online search queries submitted in that location during the week. Then, the values are adjusted to be between 0 and 1.\nThe csv file FluTrain.csv aggregates this data from January 1, 2004 until December 31, 2011 as follows:\n “Week” - The range of dates represented by this observation, in year/month/day format. “ILI” - This column lists the percentage of ILI-related physician visits for the corresponding week. “Queries” - This column lists the fraction of queries that are ILI-related for the corresponding week, adjusted to be between 0 and 1 (higher values correspond to more ILI-related search queries).  Before applying analytics tools on the training set, we first need to understand the data at hand. Looking at the time period 2004-2011, which week corresponds to the highest percentage of ILI-related physician visits?\nLoading the data FluTrain \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;FluTrain.csv\u0026quot;) summary(FluTrain)  Week ILI Queries 2004-01-04 - 2004-01-10: 1 Min. :0.5341 Min. :0.04117 2004-01-11 - 2004-01-17: 1 1st Qu.:0.9025 1st Qu.:0.15671 2004-01-18 - 2004-01-24: 1 Median :1.2526 Median :0.28154 2004-01-25 - 2004-01-31: 1 Mean :1.6769 Mean :0.28603 2004-02-01 - 2004-02-07: 1 3rd Qu.:2.0587 3rd Qu.:0.37849 2004-02-08 - 2004-02-14: 1 Max. :7.6189 Max. :1.00000 (Other) :411  str(FluTrain) \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 417 obs. of 3 variables: $ Week : Factor w/ 417 levels \u0026quot;2004-01-04 - 2004-01-10\u0026quot;,..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... $ ILI : num 2.42 1.81 1.71 1.54 1.44 ... $ Queries: num 0.238 0.22 0.226 0.238 0.224 ...

Plot the histogram of the dependent variable, ILI.\nWhat best describes the distribution of values of ILI?\nhist(FluTrain$ILI) Most of the ILI values are small, with a relatively small number of much larger values (in statistics, this sort of data is called “skew right”).   Problem 1.3 - EDA When handling a skewed dependent variable, it is often useful to predict the logarithm of the dependent variable instead of the dependent variable itself – this prevents the small number of unusually large or small observations from having an undue influence on the sum of squared errors of predictive models.\nIn this problem, I’ll predict the natural log of the ILI variable, which can be computed using the log() function. Plot the natural logarithm of ILI versus Queries.\nplot(log(FluTrain$ILI), FluTrain$Queries) plot(FluTrain$Queries, log(FluTrain$ILI)) What does the plot suggest? #### There is a positive, linear relationship between log(ILI) and Queries.\n Problem 2.1 - Linear Regression Model Based on the plot we just made, it seems that a linear regression model could be a good modeling choice.

This sort of dataset is called a “time series.”\nOften, statistical models can be improved by predicting the current value of the dependent variable using the value of the dependent variable from earlier weeks. In our models, this means we will predict the ILI variable in the current week using values of the ILI variable from previous weeks.\nFirst, we need to decide the amount of time to lag the observations. Because the ILI variable is reported with a 1- or 2-week lag, a decision maker cannot rely on the previous week’s ILI value to predict the current week’s value. Instead, the decision maker will only have data available from 2 or more weeks ago.\nWe will build a variable called ILILag2 that contains the ILI value from 2 weeks before the current observation.\nTo do so, we’ll use the “zoo” package, which provides a number of helpful methods for time series models. While many functions are built into R, you need to add new packages to use some functions. New packages can be installed and loaded easily in R. Run the following two codes to install and load the zoo package.\nIn the first code, you will be prompted to select a CRAN mirror to use for your download. Select a mirror near you geographically. install.packages(“zoo”)\nAfter installing and loading the zoo package, create the ILILag2 variable in the training set.\nILILag2 = lag(zoo(FluTrain$ILI), -2, na.pad=TRUE) FluTrain$ILILag2 = coredata(ILILag2) The value of -2 passed to lag means to return 2 observations before the current one; a positive value would have returned future observations. The parameter na.pad=TRUE means to add missing values for the first two weeks of our dataset, where we can’t compute the data from 2 weeks earlier.\n?lag ?coredata ILILag2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NA NA

Problem 5.1 - Evaluating the Time Series Model in the Test Set So far, we have only added the ILILag2 variable to the FluTrain dataframe. To make predictions with our FluTrend2 model, we’ll also need to add ILILag2 to the FluTest dataframe (note that adding variables before splitting into a training and testing set can prevent this duplication of effort).\nModifying the code from the previous subproblem to add an ILILag2 variable to the FluTest dataframe.\nHow many missing values are there in this new variable?\nTest_ILILag2 = lag(zoo(FluTest$ILI), -2, na.pad=TRUE) FluTest$ILILag2 = coredata(Test_ILILag2) sum(is.na(FluTest$ILILag2)) [1] 2  Problem 5.2 - Evaluating the Time Series Model in the Test Set In this problem, the training and testing sets are split sequentially – the training set contains all observations from 2004-2011 and the testing set contains all observations from 2012.\nThere is no time gap between the two datasets, meaning the first observation in FluTest was recorded one week after the last observation in FluTrain. From this, we can identify how to fill in the missing values for the ILILag2 variable in FluTest. Which value should be used to fill in the ILILag2 variable for the first observation in FluTest?\nThe ILI value of the second-to-last observation in the FluTrain dataframe. Which value should be used to fill in the ILILag2 variable for the second observation in FluTest? #### The ILI value of the last observation in the FluTrain dataframe.\n Problem 5.3 - Evaluating the Time Series Model in the Test Set Fill in the missing values for ILILag2 in FluTest. In terms of syntax, you could set the value of ILILag2 in row “x” of the FluTest dataframe to the value of ILI in row “y” of the FluTrain dataframe with “FluTest\\(ILILag2[x] = FluTrain\\)ILI[y]”.\nUse the answer to the previous questions to determine the appropriate values of “x” and “y”. It may be helpful to check the total number of rows in FluTrain using str(FluTrain) or nrow(FluTrain).\nnrow(FluTrain) [1] 417 FluTest$ILILag2[1] = FluTrain$ILI[416] FluTest$ILILag2[2] = FluTrain$ILI[417] What is the new value of the ILILag2 variable in the first row of FluTest?\nFluTrain$ILI[416] [1] 1.852736 FluTest$ILILag2[1] [1] 1.852736 What is the new value of the ILILag2 variable in the second row of FluTest?\nFluTrain$ILI[417] [1] 2.12413 FluTest$ILILag2[2] [1] 2.12413  Problem 5.4 - Evaluating the Time Series Model in the Test Set Obtain test-set predictions of the ILI variable from the FluTrend2 model, again remembering to call the exp() function on the result of the predict() function to obtain predictions for ILI instead of log(ILI).\nWhat is the test-set RMSE of the FluTrend2 model?\nPredTest2 = exp(predict(FluTrend2, newdata=FluTest)) FluTestSSE2 = sum((PredTest2 - FluTest$ILI)^2) FluTestRMSE2 = sqrt(FluTestSSE2/nrow(FluTest)) FluTestRMSE2 [1] 0.2942029  Problem 5.5 - Evaluating the Time Series Model in the Test Set Which model obtained the best test-set RMSE? #### FluTrend2 (less RMSE is better)\nConclusion In this analysis, I’ve used a simple time series model with a single lag term. ARIMA models are a more general form of the model we built, which can include multiple lag terms as well as more complicated combinations of previous values of the dependent variable.\n  ","date":1554508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554508800,"objectID":"fc1cd3da47244505d6c2a5717a1bee4f","permalink":"/project/flu_epidemics/flu_epidemics/","publishdate":"2019-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/flu_epidemics/flu_epidemics/","section":"project","summary":"The Google Flu Trends project","tags":["R","Data Analytics","Machine Learning"],"title":"Detecting Flu Epidemics via Search Engine Query Data","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a test given every three years to 15-year-old students from around the world to evaluate their performance in mathematics, reading, and science.\nThe test provides a quantitative way to compare the performance of students from different parts of the world.\nIn this analysis, I’ll predict the reading scores of students from the USA on the 2009 PISA exam.\nThe datasets contain information about the demographics and schools for American students taking the exam, derived from 2009 PISA Public-Use Data Files distributed by the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

In this way, a factor with n levels is replaced by n-1 binary variables. The reference level is typically selected to be the most frequently occurring level in the dataset.\nAs an example, consider the unordered factor variable “color”, with levels “red”, “green”, and “blue”. If “green” were the reference level, then we would add binary variables “colored” and “colorblue” to a linear regression problem. All red examples would have colored=1 and colorblue=0. All blue examples would have colored=0 and colorblue=1. All green examples would have colored=0 and colorblue=0.\nNow, consider the variable “raceeth” in our problem, which has levels “American Indian/Alaska Native”, “Asian”, “Black”, “Hispanic”,\n“More than one race”, “Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander”, and “White”.\nBecause it’s the most common in our population, we will select White as the reference level.\nWhich binary variables will be included in the regression model?\nstr(pisaTrain) \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 2414 obs. of 24 variables: $ grade : int 11 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 9 ... $ male : int 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 ... $ raceeth : Factor w/ 7 levels \u0026quot;American Indian/Alaska Native\u0026quot;,..: 7 3 4 7 5 4 7 4 7 7 ... $ preschool : int 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ expectBachelors : int 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ... $ motherHS : int 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ... $ motherBachelors : int 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ... $ motherWork : int 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ... $ fatherHS : int 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 ... $ fatherBachelors : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 ... $ fatherWork : int 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 ... $ selfBornUS : int 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 ... $ motherBornUS : int 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 ... $ fatherBornUS : int 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 ... $ englishAtHome : int 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 ... $ computerForSchoolwork: int 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 ... $ read30MinsADay : int 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 ... $ minutesPerWeekEnglish: int 450 200 250 300 294 232 225 270 275 225 ... $ studentsInEnglish : int 25 23 35 30 24 14 20 25 30 15 ... $ schoolHasLibrary : int 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ publicSchool : int 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 ... $ urban : int 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ... $ schoolSize : int 1173 2640 1095 1913 899 1733 149 1400 1988 915 ... $ readingScore : num 575 458 614 439 466 ... - attr(*, \u0026quot;na.action\u0026quot;)= \u0026#39;omit\u0026#39; Named int 1 3 6 7 9 11 13 21 29 30 ... ..- attr(*, \u0026quot;names\u0026quot;)= chr \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;6\u0026quot; \u0026quot;7\u0026quot; ...  raceethAmerican Indian/Alaska Native raceethAsian raceethBlack raceethHispanic raceethMore than one race raceethNative Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander   Problem 2.3 - Example unordered factors Consider again adding our unordered factor race to the regression model with reference level “White”. For a student who is Asian, which binary variables would be set to 0. All remaining variables will be set to 1. (all except raceethAsian) #### all\n Problem 3.1 - Building a model Because the race variable takes on text values, it was loaded as a factor variable when we read in the dataset with read.csv() – you can see this when you run str(pisaTrain) or str(pisaTest).\nHowever, by default R selects the first level alphabetically (“American Indian/Alaska Native”) as the reference level of our factor instead of the most common level (“White”).\nLet’s Set the reference level of the factor.\npisaTrain$raceeth = relevel(pisaTrain$raceeth, \u0026quot;White\u0026quot;) pisaTest$raceeth = relevel(pisaTest$raceeth, \u0026quot;White\u0026quot;) Now, building a linear regression model (call it lmScore) using the training set to predict readingScore using all the remaining variables. It would be time-consuming to type all the variables, but R provides the shorthand notation “readingScore ~ .” to mean “predict readingScore using all the other variables in the dataframe.” The period is used to replace listing out all of the independent variables.\nAs an example, if our dependent variable is called “Y”, our independent variables are called “X1”, “X2”, and “X3”, and our training dataset is called “Train”, instead of the regular notation: LinReg = lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3, data = Train)\nYou would use the following code to build our model: LinReg = lm(Y ~ ., data = Train)\nlmScore \u0026lt;- lm(readingScore ~ ., data = pisaTrain) What is the Multiple R-squared value of lmScore on the training set?\nsummary(lmScore)  Call: lm(formula = readingScore ~ ., data = pisaTrain) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -247.44 -48.86 1.86 49.77 217.18 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

The consequences of a continued rise in global temperature will be dire. Rising sea levels and an increased frequency of extreme weather events will affect billions of people.\nIn this analysis, I’ll attempt to study the relationship between average global temperature and several other factors.\nThe file climate_change.csv contains climate data from May 1983 to December 2008. The available variables include:\n Year: the observation year. Month: the observation month. Temp: the difference in degrees Celsius between the average global temperature in that period and a reference value. This data comes from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. CO2, N2O, CH4, CFC.11, CFC.12: atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F; commonly referred to as CFC-11) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2; commonly referred to as CFC-12), respectively. This data comes from the ESRL/NOAA Global Monitoring Division.  CO2, N2O and CH4 are expressed in ppmv (parts per million by volume – i.e., 397 ppmv of CO2 means that CO2 constitutes 397 millionths of the total volume of the atmosphere) CFC.11 and CFC.12 are expressed in ppbv (parts per billion by volume).  Aerosols: the mean stratospheric aerosol optical depth at 550 nm. This variable is linked to volcanoes, as volcanic eruptions result in new particles being added to the atmosphere, which affect how much of the sun’s energy is reflected back into space. This data is from the Godard Institute for Space Studies at NASA. TSI: the total solar irradiance (TSI) in W/m2 (the rate at which the sun’s energy is deposited per unit area). Due to sunspots and other solar phenomena, the amount of energy that is given off by the sun varies substantially with time. This data is from the SOLARIS-HEPPA project website. MEI: multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation index (MEI), a measure of the strength of the El Nino/La Nina-Southern Oscillation (a weather effect in the Pacific Ocean that affects global temperatures). This data comes from the ESRL/NOAA Physical Sciences Division.  We are interested in how changes in these variables affect future temperatures, as well as how well these variables explain temperature changes so far.

However, the regression coefficients of both the N2O and CFC-11 variables are negative, indicating that increasing atmospheric concentrations of either of these two compounds is associated with lower global temperatures.\nWhich of the following is the simplest correct explanation for this contradiction? #### All of the gas concentration variables reflect human development - N2O and CFC.11 are correlated with other variables in the dataset.\nCompute the correlations between all the variables in the training set.\ncor(climate_train)  Year Month MEI CO2 CH4 Year 1.00000000 -0.0279419602 -0.0369876842 0.98274939 0.91565945 Month -0.02794196 1.0000000000 0.0008846905 -0.10673246 0.01856866 MEI -0.03698768 0.0008846905 1.0000000000 -0.04114717 -0.03341930 CO2 0.98274939 -0.1067324607 -0.0411471651 1.00000000 0.87727963 CH4 0.91565945 0.0185686624 -0.0334193014 0.87727963 1.00000000 N2O 0.99384523 0.0136315303 -0.0508197755 0.97671982 0.89983864 CFC.11 0.56910643 -0.0131112236 0.0690004387 0.51405975 0.77990402 CFC.12 0.89701166 0.0006751102 0.0082855443 0.85268963 0.96361625 TSI 0.17030201 -0.0346061935 -0.1544919227 0.17742893 0.24552844 Aerosols -0.34524670 0.0148895406 0.3402377871 -0.35615480 -0.26780919 Temp 0.78679714 -0.0998567411 0.1724707512 0.78852921 0.70325502 N2O CFC.11 CFC.12 TSI Aerosols Year 0.99384523 0.56910643 0.8970116635 0.17030201 -0.34524670 Month 0.01363153 -0.01311122 0.0006751102 -0.03460619 0.01488954 MEI -0.05081978 0.06900044 0.0082855443 -0.15449192 0.34023779 CO2 0.97671982 0.51405975 0.8526896272 0.17742893 -0.35615480 CH4 0.89983864 0.77990402 0.9636162478 0.24552844 -0.26780919 N2O 1.00000000 0.52247732 0.8679307757 0.19975668 -0.33705457 CFC.11 0.52247732 1.00000000 0.8689851828 0.27204596 -0.04392120 CFC.12 0.86793078 0.86898518 1.0000000000 0.25530281 -0.22513124 TSI 0.19975668 0.27204596 0.2553028138 1.00000000 0.05211651 Aerosols -0.33705457 -0.04392120 -0.2251312440 0.05211651 1.00000000 Temp 0.77863893 0.40771029 0.6875575483 0.24338269 -0.38491375 Temp Year 0.78679714 Month -0.09985674 MEI 0.17247075 CO2 0.78852921 CH4 0.70325502 N2O 0.77863893 CFC.11 0.40771029 CFC.12 0.68755755 TSI 0.24338269 Aerosols -0.38491375 Temp 1.00000000 The following independent variables is N2O, highly correlated with (absolute correlation greater than 0.7)? #### CO2, CH4, CFC.12\nThe following independent variables is CFC.11, highly correlated with? #### CH4, CFC.12\n Simplifying the Model Given that the correlations are so high, let us focus on the N2O variable and build a model with only MEI, TSI, Aerosols and N2O as independent variables.

The model R2 is 0.7261\n Automatically Building the Model We have many variables in this analysis, and as we have seen above, dropping some from the model does not decrease model quality. R provides a function, step, that will automate the procedure of trying different combinations of variables to find a good compromise of model simplicity and R2.\nThis trade-off is formalized by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) - it can be informally thought of as the quality of the model with a penalty for the number of variables in the model.\nThe step function has one argument - the name of the initial model. It returns a simplified model. Using the step function in R to derive a new model, with the full model as the initial model (HINT: If your initial full model was called “climateLM”, you could create a new model with the step function by typing step(climateLM). Be sure to save your new model to a variable name so that you can look at the summary.

Time Plot and Histogram of ATM3 shows the data consists mostly of zero values with a handful of transactions occurring at the end of the series. ATM3 will not be modeled due to these degenerative properties. Time Plot and Histogram of ATM4 shows an extreme outlier around the three-quarter mark of the series. The horizontal lines in the Time Plots delineate $1, $20, and $100 in red, green, and blue; respectively.   ACF and PACF ACF plot shows the autocorrelations between each observation and its immediate predecessor (lagged observation). The PACF plot shows the autocorrelations between the current observation and each individual lagged observation The xts::xts()function converts data to a time series object which displays better in visualizations than time series objects created using other packages.\npar(mfrow=c(4, 2), mar = c(3, 5, 0, 0), oma = c(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5)) for(i in 1:length(levels(atm$ATM))) { atm_sub \u0026lt;- subset(atm, ATM == paste0(\u0026quot;ATM\u0026quot;, i)) atm_ts \u0026lt;- xts::xts(atm_sub$Cash, order.by=atm_sub$DATE) acf(na.omit(atm_ts), ylab=paste0(\u0026quot;ACF ATM\u0026quot;, i), main=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) pacf(na.omit(atm_ts), ylab=paste0(\u0026quot;PACF ATM\u0026quot;, i), main=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) } Observations:\n ACF and PACF plots for ATM1, ATM2, and ATM3 show autocorrelation between each observation and its immediate predecessor and autocorrelation between the current observation and other individual lagged observations. The ACF and PACF plots for ATM3 however, are not reliable due to the death of observations.   Clean The Data Data are cleaned using forecast::tsclean() and then converted to a time series object using the ts() function. The tsclean() function imputes nulls and removes outliers. The ts()function converts data to a time series object which is compatible with the forecast package.\nfor(i in 1:length(levels(atm$ATM))) { atm_num \u0026lt;- paste0(\u0026quot;ATM\u0026quot;, i) atm_sub \u0026lt;- subset(atm, ATM == atm_num, select=-2) atm_sub$Cash \u0026lt;- forecast::tsclean(atm_sub$Cash, replace.missing=T) assign(atm_num, ts(atm_sub$Cash, frequency = 7, start=start(atm_sub$DATE))) }  Trend Examine A moving average smoother is helpful in examining what kind of trend is involved in a series. Moving average models should not be confused with moving average smoothing. A moving average model is used for forecasting future values while moving average smoothing is used for estimating the trend-cycle component of past values. The ma() function computes a simple moving average smoother of a given time series.\npar(mfrow=c(3, 1), mar = c(0, 4, 0, 0), oma = c(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5)) plot(ATM1, col=8, xaxt = \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;, ylab=\u0026quot;ATM1\u0026quot;) lines(forecast::ma(ATM1, order=7), col=2) # weekly lines(forecast::ma(ATM1, order=30), col=4) # monthly plot(ATM2, col=8, xaxt = \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;, ylab=\u0026quot;ATM3\u0026quot;) lines(forecast::ma(ATM2, order=7), col=2) # weekly lines(forecast::ma(ATM2, order=30), col=4) # monthly plot(ATM4, col=8, xaxt = \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;, ylab=\u0026quot;ATM4\u0026quot;) lines(forecast::ma(ATM4, order=7), col=2) # weekly lines(forecast::ma(ATM4, order=30), col=4) # monthly Observations:\n The 7-day (weekly) and 30-day (monthly) moving average smoother line shows that the data for the ATMs have no apparent trend.   Data Decomposition Plot Decomposition Plot decomposes and plots the observed values, the underlying trend, seasonality, and randomness of the time series data.\nplot(decompose(ATM1), col=3) plot(decompose(ATM2), col=3) plot(decompose(ATM4), col=3) Observations:\n Plotting the trend-cycle and seasonal indices computed by additive decomposition shows that the data have no apparent trend, seasonal fluctuations, and fairly random residuals.   Stationarity Test Dickey-Fuller Test An augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test evaluates if the data exhibit a Stationarity process with deterministic trend or a Stationarity process with stochastic trend.\ntseries::adf.test(ATM1) Warning in tseries::adf.test(ATM1): p-value smaller than printed p-value  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: ATM1 Dickey-Fuller = -4.5329, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary tseries::adf.test(ATM2) Warning in tseries::adf.test(ATM2): p-value smaller than printed p-value  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: ATM2 Dickey-Fuller = -6.046, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary tseries::adf.test(ATM4) Warning in tseries::adf.test(ATM4): p-value smaller than printed p-value  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: ATM4 Dickey-Fuller = -5.6304, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary The augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test p-values are below α=0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis that the data has unit roots is rejected. The data exhibit stochastic trend which suggests using regression (AR) in lieu of differencing. Autoregressive (AR) modeling acts like partial differencing when ϕ\u0026lt;1. When ϕ=1 the AR(1) model is like a first-order difference.\n  Model Data The train and test sets are created by referencing rows by index.\n# train/test split index_train \u0026lt;- 1:(length(ATM1) - 30) ATM1_train \u0026lt;- ts(ATM1[index_train], frequency=7) ATM1_test \u0026lt;- ts(ATM1[-index_train], frequency=7) index_train \u0026lt;- 1:(length(ATM2) - 30) ATM2_train \u0026lt;- ts(ATM2[index_train], frequency=7) ATM2_test \u0026lt;- ts(ATM2[-index_train], frequency=7) index_train \u0026lt;- 1:(length(ATM3) - 30) ATM3_train \u0026lt;- ts(ATM3[index_train], frequency=7) ATM3_test \u0026lt;- ts(ATM3[-index_train], frequency=7) index_train \u0026lt;- 1:(length(ATM4) - 30) ATM4_train \u0026lt;- ts(ATM4[index_train], frequency=7) ATM4_test \u0026lt;- ts(ATM4[-index_train], frequency=7) The indexed rows for the test set are a window at the end of the times series. The window sized for the testing set is that of the desired prediction. The training set window is comprised of the indexes which are the complement of the test set indexes.\n Transformation The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test results support not differencing. Data can be seasonally adjusted for modeling and then reseasonalized for predictions. The modeling algorithm being used evaluates seasonal components and produces predictions that reflect the seasonality in the underlying data. Therefore, the data need not be seasonally adjusted.Heteroskedasticity refers to the circumstance in which the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable. Box-Cox transformations can help to stabilize the variance of a time series.\n(lambda1 \u0026lt;- forecast::BoxCox.lambda(ATM1_train)) [1] 0.4355901 (lambda2 \u0026lt;- forecast::BoxCox.lambda(ATM2_train)) [1] 0.7156895 (lambda4 \u0026lt;- forecast::BoxCox.lambda(ATM4_train)) [1] 0.3945256 The Box-Cox transformation parameters suggested are around λ=0.5. This rounded (more interpretable) value is suggestive of a 1/yt‾‾√ transformation. These Box-Cox transformations stabilize the variance and make each series relatively homoskedastic with equal variance.\n ARIMA Model The auto.arima() function chooses an ARIMA model automatically.

Moving average models should not be confused with moving average smoothing. A moving average model is used for forecasting future values while moving average smoothing is used for estimating the trend-cycle component of past values. The ma() function computes a simple moving average smoother of a given time series.\nplot(kWh, col=8, xaxt = \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;, ylab=\u0026quot;ATM1\u0026quot;) lines(forecast::ma(kWh, order=6), col=6) # pink line biannual period lines(forecast::ma(kWh, order=12), col=4) # blue line annual period Observations:\n The 6-month and 12-month moving average smoother line shows that the data has a slight apparent trend.   Data Decomposition Plot Decomposes and plots the observed values, the underlying trend, seasonality, and randomness of the time series data.\nplot(decompose(kWh), col=5) Obseravations:\n Plotting the trend-cycle and seasonal indices computed by additive decomposition shows that the data have a slight apparent trend, seasonal fluctuations, and fairly random residuals.   Stationarity Test Dickey_Fuller Test An augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test evaluates if the data exhibit a Stationarity process with deterministic trend or a Stationarity process with stochastic trend.\ntseries::adf.test(kWh) Warning in tseries::adf.test(kWh): p-value smaller than printed p-value  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: kWh Dickey-Fuller = -4.5454, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary The augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test p-value is below α=0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis that the data has unit roots is rejected. The data exhibit stochastic trend which suggests using regression (AR) in lieu of differencing. Autoregressive (AR) modeling acts like partial differencing when ϕ\u0026lt;1. When ϕ=1 the AR(1) model is like a first-order difference.\n  Model Data The train and test sets are created by referencing rows w/ index. The indexed rows for the testing set are a window at the end of the times series. The window sized for the test set is that of the desired prediction. The training set window is comprised of the indexes which are the complement of the test set indexes.\nindex_train \u0026lt;- 1:(length(kWh) - 12) kWh_train \u0026lt;- ts(kWh[index_train], frequency=12) kWh_test \u0026lt;- ts(kWh[index_train], frequency=12)  Transformation The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test results support not differencing. Data can be seasonally adjusted for modeling and then reseasonalized for predictions. The modeling algorithm being used evaluates seasonal components and produces predictions that reflect the seasonality in the underlying data. Therefore, the data need not be seasonally adjusted. Heteroskedasticity refers to the circumstance in which the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable. Box-Cox transformations can help to stabilize the variance of a time series.\n(lambda \u0026lt;- forecast::BoxCox.lambda(kWh_train)) [1] -0.1733063 The Box-Cox transformation parameter suggested is about λ=−0.25. This rounded (slightly more interpretable) value is suggestive of an inverse quartic root. This Box-Cox transformation stabilizes the variance and makes the series relatively homoskedastic with equal variance.\n ARIMA Model The auto.arima() function chooses an ARIMA model automatically. It uses a variation of the Hyndman and Khandakar algorithm which combines unit root tests, minimization of the AICc, and MLE to obtain an ARIMA model. The function takes some short-cuts in order to speed up the computation and will not always yield the best model. Setting stepwise and approximation to FALSE prevents the function from taking short-cuts.\n(fit \u0026lt;- forecast::auto.arima(kWh_train, stepwise=F, approximation=F, d=0, lambda=lambda)) Series: kWh_train ARIMA(0,0,3)(2,1,0)[12] with drift Box Cox transformation: lambda= -0.1733063 Coefficients: ma1 ma2 ma3 sar1 sar2 drift 0.2807 0.0855 0.2232 -0.7724 -0.4408 1e-04 s.e. 0.0757 0.0823 0.0687 0.0742 0.0812 1e-04 sigma^2 estimated as 3.707e-05: log likelihood=621.98 AIC=-1229.95 AICc=-1229.25 BIC=-1208.08 The auto.arima() function suggests an ARIMA(0,0,3)(2,1,0)12 model.\n Evaluation par(mfrow=c(2, 1), mar = c(3, 5, 0, 0), oma = c(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5)) acf(residuals(fit), ylab=\u0026quot;ACF kWh\u0026quot;); pacf(residuals(fit), ylab=\u0026quot;PACF kWh\u0026quot;) Observations:\n The residuals of the model appear to display the characteristics of White Noise in both the ACF and PACF plots.

There are no data points when the overall height is 7 and highest surface area range and also for low overall height 3.5, we have no data points with the low surface area range.

(Higher the wall area, higher the heating load).   Plot Cooling Load Efficiency # plot how \u0026#39;Wall.Area\u0026#39; influence cooling load using raster plot. ggplot(df, aes(Surface.Area, Roof.Area)) + geom_raster(aes(fill = Cooling.Load), interpolate = TRUE) + scale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;steelblue\u0026quot;)+ facet_wrap(~Wall.Area, scales = \u0026quot;free\u0026quot; )+ ggtitle(\u0026#39;Measuring Cooling Load distribution \\n by Wall Area, Surface Area and Roof Area\u0026#39;) + xlab(\u0026#39;Surface Area\u0026#39;) + ylab(\u0026#39;Roof Area\u0026#39;) + theme_classic() Observations:\n So, Wall Area plays a significant role in both Heating and Cooling Load efficiency.   Plot Energy Efficiency # we have seen more variation in load data when the overall height is (7.0). So lets create a subset named(energy.eff.sub7.0) which contains the filtered data with overall height = 7.0. Lets visualize, if the \u0026#39;Roof.Area\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Wall.Area\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Surface.Area\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;Glazing.Area\u0026#39; are influencing the load efficiency. energy.eff.sub7.0 \u0026lt;- df[ df$Overall.Height ==7.0,] ggplot(energy.eff.sub7.0, aes(x = Cooling.Load, y = Heating.Load, group = factor(round(Wall.Area)), size = Glazing.Area, shape = factor(round(Wall.Area))))+ geom_point(aes(colour= factor(round(Surface.Area))), alpha = 0.3)+ geom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;,se = TRUE )+ facet_wrap(~ Roof.Area) + ggtitle(\u0026#39;Load efficiency by Roof Area, by Wall Area by Surface Area and by Glazing Area\u0026#39;) + theme_classic() Observations:\n It is clearly evident that the Load efficiency is influenced by the Roof Area, Wall Area, Surface Area, and Glazing Area. When the Glazing Area is high, Roof Area is high and Wall Area is high, Load will be high and viceversa.

Possible due to an increase in demand for flights and commercialisation of airlines in that time period. The boxplot shows more passengers travelling in months 6 to 9 with higher averages and higher variances than the other months, indicating seasonality within an apparent cycle of 12 months. The rationale for this could be more people taking holidays and fly over the summer months in the US. The dataset appears to be a multiplicative time series, since passenger numbers increase, with a pattern of seasonality. There do not appear to be any outliers and there are no missing values.   Data decomposition I’ll decompose the time series for estimates of trend, seasonal, and random components using moving average method.\nThe multiplicative model is:\nY[t]=T[t]∗S[t]∗e[t]\nwhere\nY(t) is the number of passengers at time t, T(t) is the trend component at time t, S(t) is the seasonal component at time t, e(t) is the random error component at time t.\ndecomposeAP \u0026lt;- decompose(AP,\u0026quot;multiplicative\u0026quot;) autoplot(decomposeAP) + theme_classic() Observations:\n In these decomposed plots we can again see the trend and seasonality as inferred previously, but we can also observe the estimation of the random component depicted under the “remainder”.   Stationarity test A stationary time series has the conditions that the mean, variance and covariance are not functions of time. In order to fit arima models, the time series is required to be stationary. I’ll use two methods to test the stationarity.\nTest stationarity of the time series (ADF)  In order to test the stationarity of the time series, let’s run the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test. using the adf.test function from the tseries R package.\nFirst set the hypothesis test:\nThe null hypothesis: that the time series is non stationary The alternative hypothesis: that the time series is stationary\nadf.test(AP) ## Warning in adf.test(AP): p-value smaller than printed p-value ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: AP ## Dickey-Fuller = -7.3186, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary As a rule of thumb, where the p-value is less than 5%, we reject the null hypothesis. As the p-value is 0.01 which is less than 0.05 we reject the null in favour of the alternative hypothesis that the time series is stationary.\nTest stationarity of the time series (Autocorrelation)  Another way to test for stationarity is to use autocorrelation. I’ll use autocorrelation function (acf). This function plots the correlation between a series and its lags ie previous observations with a 95% confidence interval in blue. If the autocorrelation crosses the dashed blue line, it means that specific lag is significantly correlated with current series.\nautoplot(acf(AP, plot=FALSE)) + labs(title=\u0026quot;Correlogram of Air Passengers from 1949 to 1961\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() Observations:\n The maximum at lag 1 or 12 months, indicates a positive relationship with the 12 month cycle.  Since we have already created the decomposeAP list object with a random component, we can plot the acf of the decomposeAP$random.\n# review random time series for any missing values decomposeAP$random  ## Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul ## 1949 NA NA NA NA NA NA 0.9516643 ## 1950 0.9626030 1.0714668 1.0374474 1.0140476 0.9269030 0.9650406 0.9835566 ## 1951 1.0138446 1.0640180 1.0918541 1.0176651 1.0515825 0.9460444 0.9474041 ## 1952 1.0258814 1.0939696 1.0134734 0.9695596 0.9632673 1.0003735 0.9468562 ## 1953 0.9976684 1.0151646 1.0604644 1.0802327 1.0413329 0.9718056 0.9551933 ## 1954 0.9829785 0.9232032 1.0044417 0.9943899 1.0119479 0.9978740 1.0237753 ## 1955 1.0154046 0.9888241 0.9775844 1.0015732 0.9878755 1.0039635 1.0385512 ## 1956 1.0066157 0.9970250 0.9876248 0.9968224 0.9985644 1.0275560 1.0217685 ## 1957 0.9937293 0.9649918 0.9881769 0.9867637 0.9924177 1.0328601 1.0261250 ## 1958 0.9954212 0.9522762 0.9469115 0.9383993 0.9715785 1.0261340 1.0483841 ## 1959 0.9825176 0.9505736 0.9785278 0.9746440 1.0177637 0.9968613 1.0373136 ## 1960 1.0039279 0.9590794 0.8940857 1.0064948 1.0173588 1.0120790 NA ## Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec ## 1949 0.9534014 1.0022198 1.0040278 1.0062701 1.0118119 ## 1950 0.9733720 1.0225047 0.9721928 0.9389527 1.0067914 ## 1951 0.9397599 0.9888637 0.9938809 1.0235337 1.0250824 ## 1952 0.9931171 0.9746302 1.0046687 1.0202797 1.0115407 ## 1953 0.9894989 0.9934337 1.0192680 1.0009392 0.9915039 ## 1954 0.9845184 0.9881036 0.9927613 0.9995143 0.9908692 ## 1955 0.9831117 1.0032501 1.0003084 0.9827720 1.0125535 ## 1956 1.0004765 1.0008730 0.9835071 0.9932761 0.9894251 ## 1957 1.0312668 1.0236147 1.0108432 1.0212995 1.0005263 ## 1958 1.0789695 0.9856540 0.9977971 0.9802940 0.9405687 ## 1959 1.0531001 0.9974447 1.0013371 1.0134608 0.9999192 ## 1960 NA NA NA NA NA # autoplot the random time series from 7:138 which exclude the NA values autoplot(acf(decomposeAP$random[7:138], plot=FALSE)) + labs(title=\u0026quot;Correlogram of Air Passengers Random Component from 1949 to 1961\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() Observations:\n acf of the residuals are centered around zero.

Vehicles with manual transmission seems however to be more efficient: the group restricted regression (blue) has a higher intercept. It has to be highlighted however, that the parameters of blue regression might be influenced by two extreme values with high hp - the regression should be re-estimated by removing the two datapoints. mpg vs weight: negative relation, the functional form might be non-linear (hyperbolic ?), as weight of the vehicle increases, the mileage decreases. The weight variable seems to provide perfect separation between manual and auto transmission vehilces, i.e. all vehicles that are heavier than 3.2 ton (circa) are auto and vice-versa. mpg vs drat: the functional form is not clear: it appears also to be an increase in the variance as the rear axel ratio (drat) increases. To verify this a regression model using all observations has to be estimated and analyse the residuals for verifying if the model is heteroskedastic. mpg vs disp: seems to have a negative (hyperbolic ?) relation: as the displacement (disp) of the engine increases, the mileage decreases. Also, in this case it seems that disp accounts for perfect separation in the transmission type: almost all vehilces with disp \u0026gt; 180 are auto.
