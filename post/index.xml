      <description>Preamble: The dataset is available at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency].
 Reseach questions: to explore three data points, and visualize how they influence the energy load.  The following variables Wall.Area, Roof.Area, Glazing.Area are identified as key indicators that can influence the energy load efficiency for both (Heating and Cooling spaces).
 Structure of analysis: A time series forecast using the arima model as follows:
Exploratory Data Analysis Plot Load Distribution Using Scatter Plot Plot Heating Load Efficiency Plot Cooling Load Efficiency Plot Energy Efficiency  rm(list = ls()) sourceURL &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://raw.</description>

      <description>Preamble: This document focuses on the analysis of the airpassengers dataframe.
The AirPassenger dataset in R provides monthly totals of US airline passengers, from 1949 to 1960.
Description of dataframe airpassengers can be found at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/airpassengers.html
 Research question: through analysis and modelling, preview a time series forecast   Structure of analysis: I will asssess whether a linear regression or arima model is a best fit for the time series forecast as follows:</description>
