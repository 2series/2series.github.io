Bitcoin’s blockchain stores transaction data, but we can store any type of data in a blockchain.\nEthereum, for example, enables users to store code snippets called ‘smart contracts’ in their blockchain. In this project, I build a simple blockchain in Python that uses proof-of-work consensus, just like the Bitcoin protocol does. There’s a lot of misunderstanding around what the blockchain is and what it can do, so I hope this project demonstrates how simple it really is.
