      <description>Preamble: This document focuses on the time series analysis. The variable ‘Cash’ is provided in hundreds of dollars.
This is a time series spanning daily transactions from May 1, 2009 to April 30, 2010 from four ATMs.
 Research question: forecast how much cash is taken out of 4 different ATM machines for May 2010   Structure of analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis Visualizations ACF and PACF Clean The Data Trend Preview Data Decomposition Plot Stationarity Test Model Data Transformation ARIMA Model Evaluation Box-Ljung Test Forecasting Model Accuracy  sourceURL &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://raw.</description>

      <description>Preamble: The dataset is available at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency].
 Reseach questions: to explore three data points, and visualize how they influence the energy load.  The following variables Wall.Area, Roof.Area, Glazing.Area are identified as key indicators that can influence the energy load efficiency for both (Heating and Cooling spaces).
 Structure of analysis: A time series forecast using the arima model as follows:
Exploratory Data Analysis Plot Load Distribution Using Scatter Plot Plot Heating Load Efficiency Plot Cooling Load Efficiency Plot Energy Efficiency  rm(list = ls()) sourceURL &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://raw.</description>

      <description>Preamble: This document focuses on the analysis of the airpassengers dataframe.
The AirPassenger dataset in R provides monthly totals of US airline passengers, from 1949 to 1960.
Description of dataframe airpassengers can be found at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/airpassengers.html
 Research question: through analysis and modelling, preview a time series forecast   Structure of analysis: I will asssess whether a linear regression or arima model is a best fit for the time series forecast as follows:</description>
